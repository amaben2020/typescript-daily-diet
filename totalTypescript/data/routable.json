            "plaintext": "Love them or hate them, it looks like credit cards are here to stay. Sure, in\nthe wrong hands they may incentivize you to spend more than you should. But when\nused correctly, you get flexibility, fraud protection, and liquidity. All great\nthings for a burgeoning business. \n\nWhat makes business credit cards different than consumer ones?\nOn the surface, a business credit card is very similar to a consumer one.\nThey’re both lines of credit, often with a transaction and credit limit, that\nrely on underwriting to make sure that you aren’t too risky of a client. They\nboth have interest rates that you probably want to avoid paying if you can, and\nthey both have built in security measures.\n\nSome major differences emerge. Certain credit card underwriters may require:\n\n * Personal guarantees (meaning that an individual will be liable for the\n   company's debt in the event of default).\n * Credit checks (on the individual taking out the loan application, instead of\n   on the business)\n * Security deposits (that can run in the tens of thousands of dollars)\n\nIn addition, there are programs tailor their rewards to business needs, whereas\nothers just duplicate the settings they have for consumer cards. And while as a\nconsumer you want to keep your balances relatively low to keep an optimal credit\nratio, the incentives are a bit different for a company.\n\nWhere should I start my business credit card search?\nAs a business, you want to focus on scalability, ease of use, ease of paying\ndown your debt, and comfortable relationship with your provider. At the end of\nthe day, this is probably going to matter more than your interest rate -\nespecially because you’ll likely be paying off your balance before it accrues\ninterest. So start your search by narrowing down the fields you care about. \n\nWhat are my available options?\nThere are tons of corporate card programs. Most companies that offer consumer\ncards will also offer a business card option. That makes for a lot of corporate\ncard programs. \n\nSilicon Valley Bank\nAria at Silicon Valley Bank [https://www.svb.com/] suggests that one of the ways\nthat they are able to set themselves apart from the pack is with the\nrelationship teams they have on hand. If you’re a client of SVB, your contacts\nat the company help optimize credit card underwriting methods and rewards.\nBecause of their more intimate knowledge with the tech & startup industry, they\nhave a more holistic approach to business banking, which extends to their other\nproducts like their business credit cards. Transaction level controls for each\npayment also ensure accurately managed funds.\n\nBrex\nYou can’t really talk about business credit cards without also bringing up Brex\n[https://brex.com/?ref_code=routable]. In recent years they’ve aggressively\npursued new businesses by offering a unique underwriting model that allows for\nhigher credit & transaction limits, best-in-class rewards, and instant\napprovals.  Best of all, no personal guarantees required, no need to provide\nyour own social security number and no need to get your personal credit score\npulled. \n\nThe Juggernauts\nCompare that to the old-school heavyweights like AMEX\n[https://www.americanexpress.com/] or Chase [https://www.chase.com/], which\naccording to Slava at Intelli Bookkeeping [https://intellibookkeeping.com/], are\neasy to use, but don’t quite focus on the rewards that startups need most like\nfree meals and travel perks.\n\nHow do I apply for a business credit card?\nJust a few years ago, it could take weeks to go through the whole process of\ngoing into a physical bank branch, getting all of your company’s financial\nstatements, getting approved, and finally getting the plastic card in your hand\nand ready to use. If you’re looking to avoid getting your own credit score\npulled for the purpose of a business credit card, and prefer that the company\nitself be underwritten, look at SVB and Brex. Neither of them require personal\nbacking. In fact, Max at Brex says that qualified startups can start spending on\ntheir Brex card within minutes of beginning the application. Once you provide\nyour company info and link your corporate bank account, the wait time is super\nshort.\n\nIf you’re in a really early stage of your business life cycle, and don’t yet\nfeel that your company’s financials are up to snuff, there’s nothing wrong with\ngoing the more traditional route and getting yourself (as the founder or owner)\nunderwritten to help speed up the process. Slava has a great credit score, and\nhas been able to quickly issue credit cards for all four of his companies just\nbased off of his own financial stability and great credit history.\n\nWhat are the common business credit card pitfalls?\nWe’ve mentioned scalability and ease of use before, and it’s important to\nhighlight it again. As your company grows, you’re probably going to need to have\nmore than one person have access to the business card. Our more tech savvy\noptions like SVB & Brex give company administrators the option to add additional\ncards quickly and easily, and can set per-card credit limits and other\nrestrictions.\n\nMany of the legacy providers may have clunkier payment portals and reporting\ntools. If these areas are important to you, make sure to check out AMEX - Slava\ncan’t stop gushing over their quality reports & accurate ledger sync. Remember -\nkeep your accounting team happy and your finances will be much less stressful\nlater on. \n\nWhat about business debit cards?\nAs a consumer, I use my debit card all the time, so I was surprised to hear just\nabout everyone I spoke to about business credit cards suggest staying away. Aria\nmentions that the debit card is a useful tool for pulling petty cash, but still\nrecommends paying via credit card for the security and rewards mentioned\nearlier.\n\nIf you have a payment to make that exceeds your credit limit, you should also be\nable to get a temporary credit raise (something Silicon Valley Bank is happy to\ndo), instead of using your debit card. Not an option with your provider? Most\nB2B payments of that size can be paid via check, ACH, or wire, which tend to be\nmore secure (make sure to check out Routable [https://routable.com] for all your\nB2B payment needs). Fraud is top of mind here - credit cards have much more\nsecurity built in than the average debit card, and can do everything that the\ndebit card can do as well.\n\nMax echoes this statement. Given Brex’s rewards, it’s worth migrating as much\nspend as possible to your card so you can stack up those points. Slava says that\nin all his years as a company founder and owner, he’s never seen the point of\nusing his business bank issued debit card. He much prefers using Routable for\nACH payments, and credit cards for everything else.\n\nHungry for more? We’ll be looking into when and why you should hire a corporate\ncontroller in our next piece.",

When it comes to compliance: if you’re in a\nheavily-regulated industry, you may need to make this hire sooner than later.\n\n\nHow do I source good candidates?\nJustin McLoughlin [https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmmcloughlin/], airCFO\n[https://aircfo.com/]\n\nWe always start with our own employees, extended network and advisors, then work\noutward from there.  LinkedIn is an obvious, affordable option as well as\nindustry websites that allow you to post your jobs.\n\nFor example, we’re interested in hiring finance and accounting people at the\nmeeting points of startups and finance, and people that want to work remotely,\nso we look specifically to post roles in those ecosystems (e.g. Angel List).\n\nWaseem Daher [https://www.linkedin.com/in/wdaher/], Pilot.com\n[https://pilot.com]\n\nWe’ve actually helped our clients with this in the past and connected them with\npotential candidates directly. While asking your current external provider for\ncandidate references is a bit bold, it’s not the worst idea.\n\nHow much should I be paying a controller?\nJustin McLoughlin [https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmmcloughlin/], airCFO\n[https://aircfo.com/]\n\nWhile a full-time bookkeeper will probably run $25–40k a year, and staff\naccountants (someone with one to two years of experience and a degree in\naccounting, or a CPA) will run about $40–60k, the range for assistant controller\nor controller is pretty wide.\n\nA relatively new assistant controller could make $70k in the midwest, whereas an\nexperienced controller (five to fifteen years) on the coasts will likely start\naround $100k and go up from there.\n\nIt really depends on experience, location, and industry.\n\nEst. Salary for Controllers, by State\n> New York: Glassdoor says $93.1k–177k, Salary.com says $156k–330k, Built In NYC\nsays $100k–210k.\n> California: Salary.com says $144k–304k, Glassdoor says $90.5k–172k, PayScale\nsays $64.4k–147k.\n> Texas: Salary.com says $127k–270k, Glassdoor says $82.1k–158k, PayScale says\n$55.2k–129k.\n> Michigan:  Salary.com says $129k–273k, PayScale says $58.7k–123k, Glassdoor says\n$71.2k–139k.\nWhat prior requirements should be considered when interviewing?\nJustin McLoughlin [https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmmcloughlin/], airCFO\n[https://aircfo.com/]\n\nYou want someone who is familiar with your business and your industry. You don’t\nwant them to just do the month-end close, you want them to provide advice and\nexpertise about best practices.\n\nWhat about job descriptions for hiring?\nJustin McLoughlin [https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmmcloughlin/], airCFO\n[https://aircfo.com/]\n\nYou don’t need to reinvent the wheel. Simply start with a few internet searches\non existing job boards and piece together the job description and requirements\nfrom there.\n\nDo they need a team? What does that look like?\nJustin McLoughlin [https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmmcloughlin/], airCFO\n[https://aircfo.com/]\n\nYes. I'm a big fan of building a team. My advice is to start from the top and\nfill in from there. At first, you can hire a full-time controller while still\noutsourcing bookkeeping until the controller convinces you to bring it all\nin-house by adding another member to the accounting team.\n\nI've seen issues in the past (e.g., controller gets burnt out) if you hire a\ncontroller and expect them to do everything from bookkeeping to financial\nstrategy on their own.\n\nWaseem Daher [https://www.linkedin.com/in/wdaher/], Pilot.com\n[https://pilot.com]\n\nYes. The top-tier controller that you’d like to hire is rarely that excited\nabout doing the bookkeeping work. So much so, that their first move is usually\nto hire a staff accountant. \n\nWhat are the signs a controller is doing a good job? \nJustin McLoughlin [https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmmcloughlin/], airCFO\n[https://aircfo.com/]\n\nA sign of a good controller is that the processes are becoming more streamlined\nand efficient. If that isn't happening then they probably aren't building\nscalable systems.\n\nSeparately, one basic thing to do (at least quarterly) is to have someone not on\nthe accounting team review the financial statements and perform some sanity\nchecks on cash balances, revenue, etc. Alternatively, if you have a good tax\naccountant, you can ask them (and probably pay a little extra) to perform a\nhigh-level review (not during their busy tax season!).\n\nIf you have the budget and/or want the extra peace of mind, another option would\nbe to hire an independent CPA firm to do a CPA review (similar to an audit, but\nmuch less expensive and time consuming), but these can cost $10–20k. \n\nSo, when do you hire a corporate controller?\nYou can use McLoughlin’s two-thirds rule and start looking for a corporate\ncontroller when you realize you’re spending about 2/3rds of their potential\nsalary on a contractor or a service like airCFO. \n\nPerhaps then Daher would remind you: consider compliance in addition to cost,\nespecially if you’re in a heavily-regulated industry because you may need to\nmake the hire sooner than later. \n\nClearly, there are a lot of factors to consider - but we hope you found this\narticle helpful! And, when you do decide to hire a corporate controller, we can\nhelp set you up for success with tools like automation to optimize their\nprocesses. That way, your newly-hired corporate controller can focus on helping\nyour growing business... keep right on growing!",

Without AP automation, AP teams spend countless hours figuring out\nwho needs to approve each bill, get sign-offs from different stakeholders, and\ncontinuously follow up, making it difficult to make timely payments. Controllers\nwant to process payments smoothly and efficiently without wasting their AP\nteam’s time and resources. AP teams want to cut down on tedious, manual tasks to\nfocus on more value-added activities for the business.\n\nIntroducing: Multiple levels of approval\nTo help solve these challenges, we’re excited to announce multiple levels of\napproval, a new workflow feature in our accounts payable\n[https://routable.com/payables] automation solution. With this update, you can\nconfigure your bill payment workflow to allow for multiple approvers on bills\nover a specific dollar amount. Bills will automatically go through the approval\nprocess workflow you designed, eliminating the need for your AP team to chase\ndown approvers. 🙌\n\nWith this update, you can: \n\n * Customize your approval process by threshold\n * Easily keep various stakeholders in the loop and in control\n * Have greater confidence in your approval process\n * Ensure AP policy compliance\n\nHow approvals work\nYou can configure approval levels in your workflow to allow one or more\napprovers on bills over a certain dollar amount. The bill amount you specify\nwill trigger the approval workflow you designed, manually routing approvals to\nthe right people. You can set up the workflow to require approval from “any” or\n“all” of the approvers listed, depending on your AP process.

Most people\nhave heard of independent contractors, especially as the gig economy has grown.\nAccording to the ADP Research Institute, since 2010, the number of independent\ncontractors has grown a 2.2 percentage point increase, or by 15%. This change\nmeans that companies who traditionally have had W-2 based employees are starting\nto learn about the advantages of 1099 workers, also known as independent\ncontractors, freelancers, or gig workers. The benefits, disadvantages, and legal\ndifferences between these groups can be confusing, and the penalties for\nbusiness owners that misfile adds to the intimidation. We'll cover the\ndifferences in these forms and the corresponding employment types.\n\nWhat is a 1099?\nA 1099-NEC [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1099nec.pdf] form (formerly called\na 1099-MISC form) is a tax form sent to self-employed contractors if they are\npaid $600 or more during the tax year. Examples of independent contractors\ninclude freelance writers, independent graphic designers, and some consultants.\nThere are a few exceptions [https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1099msc] to this,\nsuch as for some corporations treated as c-corporations or s-corporations. There\nare also 1099-K [https://www.irs.gov/businesses/understanding-your-form-1099-k] \nforms for payments made through credit cards, third-party transactions, and\nother methods.\n\n1099: The basics\nIf you're hiring an independent contractor, your company will handle tax\nwithholdings much differently. A 1099 worker is considered self-employed and\noften employed on a contract basis for specific tasks. How they interact within\nthe company and their work are decided within that contract and can vary\ndepending on the role you want them to fill. Regarding the form itself, it is\nnecessary in part because independent contractors withhold their own employment\ntaxes since they are self-employed, not an employee of your company.\n\nWhen is a 1099 appropriate?\nFrom the IRS perspective, independence and degree of control over the employee\ndetermine whether a 1099 or W-2 is more appropriate. While this is up to\ninterpretation, the IRS website\n[https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/independent-contractor-self-employed-or-employee]\ncovers three key items to consider which employee type is more appropriate.\n\n1. Behavioral. Does the company control, or have the right to control, what the\nworker does and how the worker does his or her job?\n\nFor a 1099 worker, their independence is often confirmed through the contract\nyou sign with them upon hiring. Usually, they don't have nearly the amount of\ninstruction as a regular employee, as they only create a product or provide a\nservice by a certain deadline. This structure means they often work where and\nwhen they want to and are not usually trained by the company.\n\n2. Financial. Are the business aspects of the worker's job controlled by the\npayer? (these include things like how worker is paid, whether expenses are\nreimbursed, who provides tools/supplies, etc.)\n\nThis one can be confusing. Independent contractors often pay for all of their\nequipment, such as a home office, and are more likely to have unreimbursed\nexpenses. These workers are also usually free to work at multiple establishments\nsimultaneously and are not guaranteed a regular hourly or weekly wage.\n\n3. Type of Relationship. Are there written contracts or employee type benefits\n(i.e. pension plan, insurance, vacation pay, etc.)? Will the relationship\ncontinue, and is the work performed a key aspect of the business?\n\nThese freelance workers often have a contract stating they are an independent\ncontractor, and these deals often don't include employee benefits. When hired as\nan independent contractor, there is most likely not an expectation of\npermanency, and the services are not a key business activity.\n\nWhat is a W-2?\nA W-2 [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw2.pdf] form is required for all typical\nbusiness employees and shows an employee's salary information along with federal\nand state income tax withholdings.\n\nW-2: The basics\nWhen you onboard a long-term employee into your company and withhold income,\nsocial security, or Medicare tax, you will need to fill out a W-2 form for them.\nThis form is also known as the Wage and Tax Statement. They are also used to\nreport FICA taxes for employees throughout the year.\n\nWhen is a W-2 appropriate?\nOpposite of the 1099 independent contractors, a W-2 is most appropriate if the\nemployee has less independence from your organization. For instance, these\nworkers often follow a company policy regarding hours and where they are allowed\nto work. They often are given benefits such as health insurance and are provided\nthe entirety of the equipment they may need to work. The position is also\nusually assumed to be a long-term assignment, and they receive regular\npaychecks.\n\nHow independent contractors differ from employees\nSometimes, you may need an expert to help you with one task or project. For\nexample, you might need a graphic designer to create a few graphics for your new\nwebsite. When this is the case, rather than onboarding them as a W-2 employee\nwith regular hours, full benefits, a space in your office, and other traditional\nemployee items, it can be much more advantageous to hire them as a contractor.\nIf you know you will need this worker on a very temporary basis or sporadically,\nit can be beneficial to both parties to come to a different agreement through a\ncontract.\n\nUnlike typical employees, independent contractors usually have a short-term\ncontract in which their employment's legal considerations are detailed.\nEmployees work under a company policy that often is more strict in dictating how\nthe organization expects them to do their work, however they also receive\nbenefits and usually have a long-term planned position within the company. They\npay for their own income tax withholding, such as social security tax.\n\nChoosing employees or contractors\nThere are pros and cons to hiring contractors over employees. Contractors are\noften skilled in their craft, making them an efficient option for resolving a\nshort-term need like writing or consulting. Independent contractors withhold\ntheir own taxes, so you are not required to manage their payroll taxes or pay\nthem benefits, leading to financial savings. These workers often need minimal\ndirection and little to no resources from the company to complete their tasks.\n\nOn the other hand, training a full-time employee to do what you would hire a\ncontractor for can be a monetary and loyalty benefit for the firm in the long\nrun. You have more control over employees, while you only have the rules\ndictated in the contract with an independent contractor. Legally, things are\nmore complicated when hiring a freelance worker as workers' compensation does\nnot cover them, and you may not be able to fire them at will depending on the\ncontract, along with other technicalities.\n\nOverall, what worker classifications are best for your company depends on your\nneeds and the specific project you are looking to accomplish. Whether you are a\nsmall business owner or just learning about employee misclassification, you can\nalways take a look at the IRS guidance website\n[https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/independent-contractor-self-employed-or-employee] \nfor more information on the categories. They also have an SS-8 form\n[https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-ss-8] or Determination of Worker\nStatus form that you can fill out if you are still unsure, though these can take\nquite a bit of time to be processed. It is always recommended to reach out to an\nemployment expert when trying to make these decisions if you have any doubts.\n\nIf you're looking for a solution to pay your independent contractors, Routable\ncan help. Routable is a simple way for companies to send payments. \n\nThis post is intended for informational purposes only, and should not be taken\nas tax, accounting, or legal advice.

It’s not that we’ve raised a boatload\nmore cash, nor have we been acquired, nor have we perfected the AI to make all\naccounting data entry obsolete – but still, it’s big news.\n\nI’m incredibly excited to announce that Routable has launched a bi-directional\nsync with NetSuite.\n\nThat’s a big deal.\n\nHow Routable is powering B2B payments\nAt Routable, we’re empowering the financial backbone of the fastest growing\ncompanies, and especially “Uber for X” startups:  businesses that require a high\nvolume of payouts. Whether they’re connecting users directly with people who\nwant to rent their spare bedroom, or making it easier for you to order food\nbefore you get to a restaurant, there are a whole lot of problems they face. How\nwill these businesses get users to love their product? How will they get vendors\nto sign up?\n\nFew of these businesses are getting really excited about the incredible\nchallenge it can be to pay +10,000 vendors 2-5 times per week. And even fewer\nare thinking about the engineering hours that are required to sync the software\nused by legacy small businesses. That’s where Routable comes in.\n\nWith our API, vendors like Snackpass, Seated, and Garmentory are able to\nseamlessly pay thousands of vendors each week without opening their checkbook.\n\nWe’ve built ourselves on the back of best-in-class integrations with Xero and\nQuickBooks Online. With our NetSuite integration, we’re excited to help even\nmore companies grow and expand their marketplaces.\n\nRoutable now integrates with Oracle NetSuite\nOracle NetSuite is an incredibly powerful ERP that can be configured to empower\nmany of the world’s leading companies to do their day-to-day business. Other AP\ntools require you to painfully upload transaction data, or replicate intricate\nprocesses in NetSuite that already exist elsewhere; so much that our data shows\nthat many teams spend 40% of their time reconciling records between other AP\nsoftware and NetSuite.\n\nNot with Routable.\n\nTwo-way, real-time sync with NetSuite\nWe’ve built the first ever AP software that supports a reliable bi-directional\nsync of bills, invoices, vendors, customers, accounts and application data with\nNetSuite. When you build a workflow or custom field in NetSuite, it will\nautomatically show up in Routable – no double data-entry required.\n\nFast and easy set-up in minutes\nAnd that’s not even the best part. Because of how we’ve built Routable, you can\nintegrate our software into your NetSuite environment in mere minutes. If you’re\nusing Quickbooks or Xero, we’ll keep all of our data and help you seamlessly\ntransition to NetSuite with ease.\n\nWe’re excited to grow with you\nWhich brings me back to why I’m so incredibly excited to announce Routable’s\nintegration with NetSuite: we’re now fully ready to support your company from\nwhen it’s just a few people in a room, to when it’s one of the largest companies\nin the world.\n\nSee how Routable and NetSuite work together\nEasy workflow\nYou can start your workflow in NetSuite or in Routable.\n\nCustom fields \nWe can support any custom fields you’re using in NetSuite.\n\nNo double data entry\nYou no longer have to export payment data from another tool and upload it into\nNetSuite – we automatically do that for you with our bi-directional sync.\n\nSee your payments in one place\nYou no longer need to export a list of payments to make and log them into your\nbank one by one. Routable will automatically populate your payments.\n\nBe confident in your approval process\nEnsure the right stakeholders can easily review and approve bills without\nslowing down your process.\n\nBuild with our API\nWe built NetSuite to support companies that need to send 100K+ payments a month\nvia our API.\n\nSpecial thanks 🙏\nThanks to Miran Ahmad, Irene Becklund, Evelyn Chan, Ashish Gupta, Jonathan\nHutner, Deirdre Mullin for always lending a hand to our team and making sure we\nalways build the best features and integrations for NetSuite.\n\nInterested in learning more?\nWith Routable, Biggie's wrong: mo' money, less problems.

Before\nthe overpayment for the missing box of paper is made, the match process flags\nthe discrepancy and the appropriate communication is conducted between vendor\nand stakeholders.\n\nThe relevance of 3-way matching\nBecause there are so many details and stages that exist in the\npurchase-to-payment process, use of three-way matching is critical to prevent\noverpayment or fraud. Suppliers will do all they can to ensure that quantities\nand costs are accurate, but errors can occur, and three-way matching holds the\nsupplier accountable to the original information in the Purchase Order. The most\ncommon errors that may be found and addressed during three-way matching:\n\n * Unit quantity or cost errors. And additional 0 or a misplaced comma during\n   manual data entry can be the difference between a $100 cost and a $1,000\n   error. Further, if the original quantities ordered do not match those that\n   were received or if the unit costs have been modified these discrepancies\n   need to be acknowledged and approved.\n * Unexpected line items. If a supplier did not provide information related to\n   shipping or surcharge costs on the PO, these line items will be a red flag on\n   an invoice.\n * Missing or inaccurate tracking information. Payment delays occur where an\n   invoice PO number does not match the original PO or due date or payment terms\n   are not included.\n\n3-way matching technique\nThree-way matching can be conducted both manually and through automation. In\nboth instances, the benefits of three-way matching are the same: improved trust\nand visibility in vendor relationships, accuracy of disbursements, and ease of\nreview of documents by auditors. Manual three-way matching, however, is very\ntime consuming. And while the matching process itself is intended to catch\nerrors, when performed manually, human error remains a factor. Together, these\nlimitations can delay vendor payments which can strain relationships and result\nin late fees. To offset the drawbacks of a manual matching process, many AP\ndepartments have turned to automation for three-way matching. The automation\nreduces the amount of time AP staff spends on these critical oversight\nprocesses, freeing them up for other necessary tasks.\n\nRoutable helps companies speed up their business payments using a secure invoice\nand bill payment platform.

Among legislation\nand regulatory boards created to combat the Great Depression, the need for\nstandardized methods of reporting financial data was identified. As a result of\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the General Accepted Accounting Principles\n(GAAP) became a set of principles and regulations established to standardize how\ncompanies reported on their finances. Knowing what GAAP is and why it is\nbeneficial to your company as a reporting option will make a difference for\ncompany growth, investor speculation, and auditor review.\n\nWhat is GAAP? \nGAAP is a set of principles, standards, and procedures that are applied through\nthe use of an accrual accounting process by an AP department. Some aspects it\ncovers are: procedures on income, expenditures, financial statement\npresentation, liabilities and assets, and foreign currency. Using GAAP,\naccountants are then able to report the financial performance of a company over\na period of time, typically a fiscal year. Publicly traded companies in the\nUnited States are required to submit financial information to a non-affiliated\ncertified public accounting (CPA) firm to remain on the stock exchange.\n\nGAAP principles and standards are applied to three main financial statements:\n\n 1. Income statement (Profit and Loss statement)—The income statement focuses on\n    the revenue and expenses of a company.\n 2. Balance sheet—This report shows the capital structure of the company: owned\n    assets, investments from shareholders, and liabilities.\n 3. Cash flow statement—A statement of currency exchange over a period of time\n    that can include: cash generated by operating activities, cash equity\n    available after expenditures, modeling of cash availability where no debt\n    (leverage) is present, and reporting of net cash from one time period to the\n    next. \n\nGAAP was created, and is regulated by, the Government Accounting Standards Board\n(GASB), the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), The American Institute\nof Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), and the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC). While it is used specifically in the United States, other\ncountries have similar principal guidelines: The International Financial\nReporting Standards (IFRS) which are regulated by the International Accounting\nStandards Board (IASB). \n\nWhat is the role of GAAP?\nBecause the SEC requires larger businesses (25M+), or those that are publicly\ntraded in the United States, to report their financial information, a more\ncomprehensive and universal system is required to encourage accuracy,\naccountability, and transparency. GAAP compliance fulfills these necessities by\nproviding guiding principles and standards that all publicly traded companies\nare required to implement, creating equitable and reliable data from which\nfinancial decisions are made. Financial information created using GAAP may be\nused in federal reporting, investor agreements, audits, and internal\ndecision-making.\n\nAs a means to provide a uniform financial reporting process, GAAP serves as a\nset of principles that a company applies to their reporting practices. The FASB\nprovides GAAP guidance throughout the United States, and the GASB provides\nguidance to local governments which differs from state to state. Some local\ngovernments allow businesses to choose between cash basis accounting and accrual\nbasis accounting, however GAAP’s language applies specifically to accrual basis\naccounting. Therefore, those businesses are better off using accrual accounting\nto eliminate any complexities or discrepancies in reporting.\n\nThe two methods of accounting differ most significantly with regards to when an\naccountant reports on income and expenses. Cash basis accounting records income\nand expenditures only once an exchange of currency has occurred. Accrual\naccounting, on the other hand, records income and expenditures immediately, when\nan invoice is received or work is completed, whether or not there has been an\nactual exchange of currency. \n\nWhy is GAAP so important?\nDespite the fact that GAAP is not required for smaller private businesses,\nimplementing it may still prove to be beneficial and necessary. While\nspeculating, investors rely on GAAP practices for decision making. When they are\nable to compare like businesses with consistent financial information, they can\nmore accurately choose one business over another. Where a company has not\nimplemented GAAP, an investor may see this as a red flag. Most importantly, GAAP\naims to minimize egregious errors, intentional or otherwise, in financial\ndisclosures and accounting practices. Reporting with GAAP implemented also\nprovides more comprehensive data that a business itself can use to make\nfinancial decisions. \n\nGAAP is not law, rather a set of principles that are applied to the reporting\nprocess. That said, misuse of GAAP guidelines can lead to loss of credibility if\na company is seeking lenders or investors. Those who are interested in your\nbusiness want honesty and transparency, and GAAP helps to ensure those pillars\nof accountability. Failure to apply GAAP appropriately may also lead to\nfinancial ramifications. Historically, companies that have failed to uphold one\nor more of the GAAP principles have faced millions of dollars in fines. \n\nWhat are the 10 major principles under GAAP?\nHere is a list of the ten GAAP principles that an AP department applies to their\naccrual basis accounting process:\n\n 1.  Principle of Regularity. Accounting records are updated in a timely manner\n     and yearly reporting (federal tax filing) is completed in the time provided\n     with GAAP regulations applied.\n 2.  Principle of Consistency. The same accounting rules and systems are used\n     throughout a time period of reporting. They are also used over time so that\n     reports from one time period to another are comparable. Should any changes\n     occur, accountants are expected to explain any changes made in footnotes to\n     the documents.\n 3.  Principle of Sincerity. Accountants should strive to objectively and\n     impartially report the business financial situation.\n 4.  Principle of Permanence of Methods. Documentation of accounting methods is\n     coherent and applied consistently over time.\n 5.  Principle of Non-Compensation. Reports accurately show all information,\n     both negatives and positives, without compensation for debt by an asset or\n     revenue by an expense.\n 6.  Principle of Prudence. Financial information reported is not based on\n     probability or assumption.\n 7.  Principle of Continuity. When reporting assets, it is assumed that\n     businesses are continuing to operate. Further, it is accepted that asset\n     depreciation may be represented because these values change over time.\n 8.  Principle of Periodicity. Revenue should be allocated over the entire span\n     of its income/expenditure and not just on the final date of a transaction.\n     For example a subscription has several payments.\n 9.  Principle of Materiality / Good Faith. Accountants should in “good faith”\n     make all financial data available.\n 10. Principle of Utmost Good Faith. From the Latin phrase “uberrimae fidei,”\n     this principle presumes that all involved parties are honest.\n\nBecause GAAP is a more complex system of reporting applied to accrual\naccounting, it may not be the primary choice for a smaller business to\nimplement. The process requires a larger, skilled staff who are able to dedicate\ntheir time and resources to that primary task. However, the benefit of\nuniformity on a national level and the appeal to investors means that businesses\nthat have the ability to implement GAAP to their accounting practices are\nsetting their business up for growth and viability.",

At first\nglance, they seem very similar to a chief financial officer in that they both\ncan hold a financial manager role.

On the other hand, it isn't uncommon in a larger company to have a\ncontroller who reports to a CFO.\n\nWhile it is true that a controller can hold many of the same responsibilities as\na traditional CFO, they are usually considered a chief accounting officer.

Luckily, technology has begun to\nevolve to tackle these issues that are time-consuming for your team. Accounts\npayable automation software is the best (and possibly only) way to affordably\nscale your finance team regardless of your growth or the number of invoices\nprocessed. Below are some of the ways software is addressing the major concerns\nof today’s accounts payable teams.\n\n1. Prevent invoice fraud\nOne of the issues to be addressed is fraud, which lurks in places you wouldn’t\nexpect, like your very own invoices. According to OpenEnvoy\n[https://openenvoy.com/], a FinTech startup providing automated invoice\nauditing, 30% or more of your invoices could have unfavorable accuracy errors.\nThrowing people power and resources at the issue can prove to be extremely\ncostly. By automating the process of checking invoices to their originating\ndocuments, OpenEnvoy helps your company eliminate AP fraud and overcome careless\nsupplier invoice practices. The software automatically detects any invoice total\nor line item that doesn’t match the purchase order or estimate it was billed\nagainst down to the penny and immediately notifies you, adding money to your\nbottom line and giving you more control over your cash flow.\n\n2. Simplify B2B payments\nMaking payments at scale is expensive and challenging. AP automation software\ncan automate your vendor transactions and customer invoice management. This\ntechnology enables you to reduce the tedious manual tasks within the accounts\npayable process, saving you money by eliminating the need for human intervention\nand extra vendor management while also reducing compliance risk. You can empower\nyour accounts payable department with customized approval workflows and simple\nbulk processing that scales with your needs, whether you are paying 100 invoices\nor 10,000.\n\nAP automation software such as Routable helps you get paid faster with tools\nlike automated reminders, early payments, and flexible payment methods. You can\ntrack actions from your vendors and purchase orders, along with seeing real-time\nledger notifications increasing problem visibility. It also easily integrates\nwith your current automation system or ERP system to easily process any invoices\nyou upload, whether using PDFs, scanned paper invoices, or you convert other\ntypes of supplier invoices.\n\n3. Remove manual processes\nAP automation technologies can also streamline tedious, repetitive work that\ntakes valuable time away from your team so they can focus on more critical\nitems. In the example of invoice fraud, many financial leaders realize that\ninconsistencies hiding in their invoices are a goldmine, but the cost of hiring\na team to discover them is just too high. In addition, these teams can be prone\nto the same kind of human error that caused issues in the first place. Sometimes\nlarger companies end up outsourcing this discovery to consulting firms, while\nothers end up outsourcing their entire auditing process to payment networks.\nNeither of these options are at all ideal for a company. AP automation tools\nlike OpenEnvoy empower you to handle these audits in-house without all of the\ndaunting manual labor.\n\nThere are similar issues facing AP departments in making payments. According to\nan IOFM study\n[https://www.iofm.com/ap/process-improvement/automation/special-report-true-costs-paper-based-invoice-processing-disbursements]\n, AP departments “spend 84% of their time bogged down by a seemingly endless\nlist of manual and semi-automated invoice processes, including data capture.”\nBecause these processes take so long, they are often delayed payments, with AP\nteams scrambling to make them on-time and keep their suppliers and vendors\nhappy.

            "plaintext": "Like many start-up stories, the co-founders of Routable, Tom and Omri began\ntheirs in a basement that they entered each morning in the dark and left each\nevening... also in the dark. Over the course of 9 months and 300 customer\ndevelopment interviews, they realized that business payments were a lot like\npull requests— the mechanism software engineers use to alert their team about\nchanges to code and get it reviewed before it’s deployed. With the vision of\nbuilding an engineering and technology-centered company for finance teams, this\ninsight was key to making that vision a reality.\n\nThat insight has remained core part of Routable's DNA to this day — it\ninfluences not just our product development and design process, but also our\nhiring process. It's how we get the best engineers in the world to work on\nmodernizing business payments with us.\n\nHere’s how business payments are similar to pull requests.\n\nTickets are just bills and invoices\nIf you're an engineer, you're probably familiar with tickets — at most of the\nplaces I've worked, we've had some form of ticket driven development where you\nbegin coding a feature or fixing a bug after a ticket has been assigned to you.\nThis is important to stop rogue coding and ensure that there is a record of\nevery change in the product for compliance, debugging and more.\n\nThese are basically tickets.Like an engineering team is driven by tickets,\nfinance teams are driven by bills and invoices. Before they can transfer or\nrequest money, they need to make sure there is a record of every transaction for\ncompliance and reporting purposes.\n\nBills can come in at any time of day, in a million different formats, and from a\nbunch of different sources. Invoices that are sent out are hopefully in a more\nstandardized format, but different vendors will still have different\nrequirements that you must meet to get paid.\n\nNew code and new payments need to be double-checked for validity\nSo let’s say you’re an engineer.  You got a JIRA ticket and coded up a brilliant\nsolution. The next step is to open up a pull request and share your work with\nthe team for feedback.\n\nThe tests aren't passing. Your team has a continuous integration service that\nchecks for known security vulnerabilities, style violations, and broken tests.\nUntil you've made all those checks happy and gotten the ✅ s that you need, you\ncan't send this out to your team to review.\n\nFinance is really similar. Before an invoice or payment can be submitted,\nsomeone on the team needs to check bank account validity, if there is money in\nthe account to spend, if they’re past your bank's cut-off time for same day\nwires, and much much more. Finally, they need to ensure that the invoice or\npayment is properly recorded in your accounting software/ERP so there is a clear\nrecord of everything (especially come tax season).\n\nThere are multiple levels of approval\nExcellent — the tests are passing! Now it's time to send this to your team to\nreview. Depending on what part of the codebase you're working in, you might even\nneed to satisfy that principal engineer that's held personally responsible for\nany defect that makes its way into production.\n\n\nAgain, finance is really similar — they can't just move $15,000 without at least\none other set of eyes. For large transfers of money, expect multiple levels of\napproval all the way up to the CFO before an invoice can be sent or a bill can\nbe paid. Just like in software, an extra 0 or a period in the wrong place can\nhave a huge impact.\n\nShipping code is just like sending a large payment\nIn an incredible turn of events, the principal engineer loved your code and even\ngave you a little 🚢-it emoji. It's the end of the day Thursday though and you\nhave a concert that evening — You're pretty sure your code is good to go, but\nyou've been wrong before and you're not trying to get paged during the show. You\nhold off until Friday morning to merge.\n\n\nSame deal in finance — they’re pretty sure there’s enough to cover a large\ntransfer, but they also know that a large transfer into the company account will\nclear tomorrow morning. So just to be safe, they schedule the payment to send\ntomorrow. ✨\n\nRolling back code is like cancelling a payment (sort of)\nIt turns out that you made the right decision to delay shipping your code... an\nhour after it went out. 💥 Luckily, it impacted very few users and you were able\nto roll back the code right away and mitigate the damage.

            "plaintext": "Businesses don’t exist in a vacuum. From deliverables of office supplies to\nwarehouse leasing companies, vendors are a part of a business’s landscape. They\nprovide the day-to-day tools used to operate an office—staff amenities, office\nmanagement, fleet maintenance—as well as the raw materials that go into a\nproduct: wholesalers, freight shipping, marketing materials.\n\nWhile exact numbers are not often readily known by large businesses, many report\nto have over 100,000 vendors as part of their supply chain and operations. These\nthird-party vendors are as much a part of a business as the hourly employees\nare, and how they are identified, how they complete business objectives, and how\nthese relationships are maintained have a direct impact on the health of a\nbusiness.\n\nWhat is vendor management?\nLike any relationship, clear and concise communication is necessary to establish\na foundation that can support longevity of commitment. An effective vendor\nmanagement process is, in its simplest definition, that clear and concise\ncommunication. Vendor management is the process a business undergoes to select\nwhich vendors fulfill an identified business objective and determines how that\nengagement will proceed; clearly identifying the outcome expectations for the\nlifecycle of the relationship.\n\nHow the vendor management process works\nThe relationship that a business develops with vendors doesn’t appear overnight.\nWhile a pressing business need may pressure a procurement manager to make\nknee-jerk decisions to fulfill order demands or unanticipated growth\nopportunities, the most successful, long-term relationships are the result of\ncareful identification and implementation of a vendor management process that\nincludes the following steps:\n\nStep 1 - Identify Business Objectives\nThe first step begins in-house. For a myriad of reasons a business may determine\nthat a new vendor is needed. Perhaps there is a new product line that requires\nraw materials that are not yet sourced. Or perhaps market growth demands\nexpansion of shipments made. Some solutions can be reached within an existing\nrelationship, and this can be a financially beneficial option. However, where an\nexisting vendor cannot or does not fulfill the identified need, a business will\nneed to begin the process of finding a new vendor. \n\nWhen identifying a business need, it is important to be as explicit as possible:\nTo not just know that a specific packaging material is needed, but the frequency\nat which it is needed, budget allocation for that material, and any market\ngrowth projections that require a timeline for ramping up of vendor supplies. A\nnew vendor may be able to fill orders in Q1, but will they be able to in Q4?\n\nClear and measurable business objectives are outlined in an initial service\nlevel agreement (SLA). Expectations of compliance and desired best practices\nthat align with a business’s ideals are detailed are identified.\n\nStep 2 - Distribute Request for Proposals (RFP)\nSometimes referred to as Request for Quote (RFQ), the next step in the vendor\nmanagement process is the distribution of the business case to potential vendors\nby an acquisition team. These requests can be complex. They may include a\nmulti-step proposal process that requires an initial wide pool of potential\nvendors to submit multiple documents that demonstrate their plan and ability to\nfulfill the business need. From the initial pool, a few vendors are then invited\nto present a more formal in-person presentation to a panel of stakeholders with\ndecision making capabilities. \n\nThroughout the RFP step, it is important to determine risk assessment, garner\ndetails on quality of product, identify internal and external roadblocks, review\nwhere potential cost savings may be earned or applied, highlight customer\nservice channels, and establish how future growth and innovation may impact a\nvendor’s available resources. Additional information that is reviewed may\ninclude: renewals timelines, financials, specific qualifications or\ncertifications that make a vendor the right vendor.\n\nStep 3 - Vendor selection and contract formulation\nIt can be an exciting time once a vendor is selected. But it is also the most\ncrucial step where important guidelines and information are implemented. The SLA\nand/or contract details enter  into a negotiation phase where minutiae are\nironed out. It is imperative that expectations are clearly outlined in the\ncontract so that all parties are aware of all the roles they play in the\nlifecycle of the relationship, who the primary points of contact are, and how\npayments will be processed. \n\nStep 4 - Contract implementation\nThe signatures are on paper and the contract execution begins. The new vendor is\nonboarded and services commence. This stage is also critical as it can be an\ninput-intensive step in the process. Vendor information is added to data\ntracking systems, direct payment channels are approved, security badges are\ncreated, and orders begin. Incomplete or inaccurate data at this stage can lead\nto big issues and delays that compound down the road.\n\nBenefits of a vendor management process\nImplementing a vendor management process may feel arduous, especially while a\nvendor list remains small. But the benefits that result from a careful selection\nof what suppliers and services a business uses creates a sustainable landscape\nfor operations.\n\nReliability. By using precision to outline business needs and onboard a vendor\nthat has demonstrated they can fulfill that need, confidence in a vendor\nincreases. Further, that if for some reason these expectations are not being\nmet, the SLA can be referenced.\n\nQuality. Being able to review proposals from a pool of potential vendors ensures\nthat the choice of vendor is intentional and meaningful; that the product or\nservice that is being provided is the best possible choice within the available\nmarket.\n\nCost reduction. Because the establishment of clear expectations and\ncommunication occurs during the vendor management process, a strong foundation\nof the vendor-buyer relationship is established. This implementation lends to\nthe sustainability of a long-term relationship which can lead better AP terms\nand unit price discounts. \n\nEfficiency. When expectations are clear, the process completes itself. The\nvendor management system removes the guessing game in how vendor-buyer relations\nare conducted, improving how contract management is conducted. It mitigates\nroadblocks in AP processing, it bridges communication gaps, and it prevents\nrisks that lead customer service delays.\n\nChallenges of vendor management processes\nWhile the vendor management process provides an opportunity to get all of the\nexpectations and agreements in place at the outset of a contract, there may\nstill be challenges to the execution of the contract terms. Acknowledging these\nchallenges early on in the process can help to improve the establishment of\nvendor-buyer relations and help to ensure that the contract is being executed\nwith all due diligence.\n\nCompliance. Despite best intentions and practices on both sides of the\nrelationship, compliance with the contract expectations should always be at the\nforefront of a vendor-buyer relationship. Letting expectations lapse can\ncompound and escalate quickly.\n\nCommunication and visibility. In correlation to compliance, staying up-to-date\nand in contact with vendors is important to building successful relationships.\nLack of communication chains prevent or limit the ability of a buyer to address\ncompliance issues. Further, especially where longer contract terms exist, lack\nof communication around issues that result in interruptions to service result in\nguessing-games as to why expectations are not being met or if steps are being\ntaken to resolve issues.\n\nPayments. One of the biggest pain-points that may occur in a vendor-buyer\nrelationship is the result of a poorly executed or slow AP process. Loss of\ndiscount opportunities due to lapse in payment windows, inaccurate or incomplete\ninvoicing and PO documents create distrust for future orders, and stalled or\nlate payments can result in non-beneficial net terms.\n\nVendor management performance metrics\nTo ensure that the expectations created in an SLA or contract are completed,\nidentifying and implementing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) early on in the\nprocess—as well as establishing a means to oversee KPIs—can make all the\ndifference in the lifecycle of a successful vendor management process. \n\nEach vendor-buyer relationship will require different sets of metrics and they\nare determined by identifying desired outcomes, ranking the importance of these\noutcomes, and a data source to demonstrate the actual outcome. A company that\nprovides staff amenities may have a KPI metric of end-user satisfaction that is\ndetermined through surveys, whereas a company that provides a specific bolt used\nin production may have a KPI of invoice accuracy that tracks instances of\ndiscrepancies and is reviewed each quarter. Other examples of vendor performance\nKPIs are: vendor availability, emergency purchase rate, supplier lead time,\nprocurement return on investment (ROI).\n\nVendor management software\nThe manual labor associated with managing vendor engagement and the complexity\nof differences from vendor to vendor has given rise to the need for vendor\nmanagement software. Complex spreadsheets that quickly become outdated do not\nprovide the kind of real-time information a business needs to make decisions.\n\nVendor management software tools helps procurement employees by:\n\n * Identifying use-case for each vendor,\n * keeping vendor data up-to-date and complete,\n * automating AP processes,\n * and determining when and if KPI metrics are not being met.\n\nHow Routable can help with vendor management\nRoutable 's accounts payable [https://routable.com/payables] solution supports\nsuccessful vendor management processes. \n\n 1.

            "plaintext": "When getting familiar with your balance sheet, there are two easy to confuse yet\nvery different liability accounts - accrued expenses and accounts payable.\nAccounts payable are tracked, invoiced payments to creditors that previously\nmade credit-based sales to your company. On the other hand, accrued expenses are\nrecords of money owed to vendors when the invoice has not yet been recorded or\nreceived. Knowing when to use these two different categories is vital to having\nan accurate balance sheet. Read on to learn more about the nuances of these\nterms.\n\nWhat are accrued expenses? \nAccrued expenses, also known as accrued liabilities, generally include anything\nwhere you have received a product or service but have not yet paid for them.\nThis often is because the supplier's invoices have not yet been received but\nincludes other instances like payroll. They fall within the category of current\nliabilities, as they are often due within a year. These can be looked at as the\nopposite of a prepaid expense - expenses made prior to receiving services or\nitems. Representing your obligation to pay for some good or service in the\nfuture, keeping accurate track of these can help you show a more accurate and\nfuture-conscious record.\n\nWhat are accrued expenses in accounting?\nAccrued expenses fall within the accrual method of accounting. Compared to other\ntypes of accounting, such as cash basis accounting, it is much more accurate and\ngives a better reflection of your total financial health. While it can be more\nwork to track transactions this way, overall it is a great method for ensuring\nyour financial statement and income statement displays more accurately, showing\nyour accounts' full story. This method requires some estimation since you will\nnot have received an accurate invoice or total of what you need to pay, but it\nstill helps you better measure your accounts than if you didn't track them until\npayment.\n\nWith all that being said, the cash basis accounting method is actually more\npopular in some sectors. This type of accounting looks at net income only when\nyou receive invoices or money, not when you receive the good or service. This\noften is easier to track but can result in very misleading reports if your\naccrued expenses start adding up.\n\nWhat is an example of an accrued expense?\nAccrued expenses can sound like they apply only occasionally, however it is much\nmore common than you would expect. The most common examples of this are employee\nwages and salaries, rent, or utilities where you receive their services and pay\nthem at a later set date. Accrued expenses can also occur when you purchase\nsomething but have not yet received the service or item invoice. Along with\nthese more common examples, interest expense or interest payable also fall\nwithin this category. Some other examples are things like taxes and commissions.\nAs you can see, accrued expenses are so common that not tracking them can mean a\nhuge change in your reports!\n\nWhat is the difference between accrued expenses and accounts payable?\nAccounts payable (also sometimes just called \"payables\") usually are short-term\ndebt obligations to vendors or companies that must be paid for the services or\ngoods bought through credit. They encompass the total amount of these items\nbought through credit, and with these entries, the invoices have been recorded.\nBecause an invoice has already been received, these are accurate, measurable\nnumbers. An accounts payable account is considered a current liability.\n\nOn the other hand, accrued expenses don't have invoices associated with them\nyet, meaning they are estimations. Because of this, they are not recorded on a\ncompany's general ledger like accounts payable is. These expenses are also\nestimations unlike accounts payable and are adjusted to be accurate once the\ninvoice is received if necessary. Accrued expenses are also considered current\nliabilities.\n\nHow are accrued expenses recorded?\nWhen incurred, they create an accrued expense account in your balance sheet that\nis shown as their own line item. These show up as a current liability on your\ncompany's balance sheet. Because often you do not have an exact invoice to\nrecord from, these entries are often estimates. If there are still unresolved\nexpenses at end of the accounting period, you have to create an adjusting entry.\nOnce you pay off your adjusting journal entry debt, you credit your cash account\nand debit your accounts payable account. Once you are able to show that you have\npaid the amount, you can remove it from your balance sheet, which will decrease\nyour liabilities.\n\nIs accrued income an asset?\nAs we alluded to above, your accrued interest is tracked through your income\nstatements at the end-of-period financial statement. It shows as a current asset\non your balance sheet in your accrued receivables account and is adjusted in the\nfuture once paid.\n\nRoutable can help you automate your AP process, reduce manual data entry,  and\ngive you the flexibility to scale transactions in the future.

            "plaintext": "Purchase orders and invoices both track details of a transaction, such as vendor\nand supplier information, item quantity, buyer details, and shipping\ninformation. However, they have significant differences.\n\nTo stay compliant, you must understand the differences between these two\ndocuments. Keeping these documents accurate is also a key way to ensure you\naren't missing inventory or losing money, whether you are a small business owner\nor a large organization. Continue reading to learn the fundamental differences\nbetween these two types of documents and how they can help you monitor and\nmanage your company spending.\n\nWhat is a purchase order?\nA purchase order is created when someone within the company informs the\npurchasing department that something is needed. This is sometimes kicked off\nwith a purchase requisition. These are documents used internally by financial\ndepartments or managerial staff who create an approval process for purchases.\nOnce it is approved, a purchase order is filled out and sent to the vendor.\n\nThe purchase order (PO) is an official document that details the buyer's\nexpectation of the quantity of goods, the due date of delivery, the address of\nthe buyer, the address of the seller, the purchase order number (PO number), the\ndate of the order, a signature of the buyer, and other details about the\npurchase expectations. The seller will look at this document, and if they are\nhappy with the terms, they will send a confirmation. After that step, this is a\nlegally binding document.\n\nHow are purchase orders used?\nPurchase orders help a company track order statuses, manage vendors, and have\nconsistent formal contracts with sellers. These documents serve a handful of\npurposes. First and foremost, they provide legal documentation if something goes\nwrong with an order and you cannot amicably resolve it. For example, if you\nreceive 50 items rather than 100, you have carefully documented proof that the\nvendor made a mistake. This can be a huge deal for companies making substantial\norders and can protect them if there is legal action needed.\n\nPurchase orders can also improve your relationship with your suppliers. By\nhaving clear documentation of the products you need and your expectations, you\ncan avoid a lot of confusion within your ordering process. Purchase orders can\nalso make your orders easier to keep track of on your end, helping you budget\nmore accurately.\n\nWhy are purchase orders important?\nPurchase orders are important for several reasons, one of the most important\nbeing legal protection. They are detailed proof of any orders you've made, and\nas legally binding documents, will prove as evidence if you run into problems\nwith vendor fulfillment. They're also important for audits, since they are a\ndetailed trail of your orders orders and can easily be referenced against\ninvoices.\n\nPOs also help you keep accurate track of your orders.

That means that rather than\napproving the goods and services needed and then sending the purchase order to\nthe vendor, you are working backward through that process. The accounts payable\nteam will take the non-PO invoice, correctly code and categorize it, and get it\napproved.\n\nThese invoices are more common with contracted services or goods and are also\nknown as expense invoices.

The Clearing House itself is a financial institution that has been\naround since 1853 and is owned by large, commercial banks. The Automated\nClearing House connects myriad financial institutions including credit unions to\ncomplete transactions. Payments made using ACH take one of two forms, Direct\nPayments and Direct Deposits, with the main difference being which party is\nsending and which is receiving funds. ACH payments include: paychecks,\nemployer-reimbursed expenses, government benefits, tax refunds, annuity\npayments, and interest payments. Businesses that use ACH payments follow\noperating guidelines created by the National Clearing House Association (Nacha).\nLearn more about ACH payments here [__GHOST_URL__/setting-up-ach-payments/].\n\nBenefits of ACH payments\nIn 2020, nearly 27B transactions were made using ACH according to Nacha\n[https://www.nacha.org/]. Like the overall benefits of EFTs, ACH payments\nincrease speed of transactions and provide a secure means to make payments. For\nACH payments specifically, the ability to make batch payments increases\nproductivity and lowers costs of AP processes. An ACH batch payment is a bulk\npayment that is processed at one time with multiple recipients through various\nfinancial institutions. Where a business would traditionally need to process,\nprint, and mail each payment individually, they can now process these payments\nall at once with the transactions completing within a couple of days.\n\nCons of ACH payments\nBecause ACH payments are a type of EFT, they are also subject to similar\nchallenges: overdraft and overpayment. For example, as with any automatic\npayment system, situations may occur where payments continue despite the stop of\nbusiness relations. For ACH, timing is key. Missing batch windows can delay a\npayment to a vendor or supplier. Additionally, some banks charge fees, some up\nto $30, for ACH transactions. Finally, different institutions will have\nlimitations on the amount of ACH funds they can transfer within a day. AP\ndepartments will need to navigate payee priority so that limits do not prevent\npayments.\n\nConclusion\nWhile challenges exist, speed, accuracy and security of EFT processes will\ncontinue to improve as technology advances. There will always be a charm to\nopening your mailbox and seeing a card or check for money owed. However, these\ndeliveries take time, and where deadlines that come and go result in late fees,\nloss of trust, and even contract termination, relying on a delivery system over\nwhich your business cannot assert control can have a negative impact on business\nrelations. By understanding and utilizing processes like ACH payments,\nbusinesses gain the advantage.\n\nHow Routable can help with ACH payments\nRoutable's automated AP solution [https://routable.com/payables] can help your\nbusiness set up ACH payments for your vendors and suppliers within the United\nStates.

Much like how a new hire goes through an application, interview, and hire process, vendors are also chosen and vetted to best fit the business needs. But unlike new hires, vendors aren’t always asked to provide important tax documents prior to first payment despite the fact that this information is required by law. Below, we’ll cover what a W-9 form is, why it’s important, and when you should request it from your vendors.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-an-irs-form-w-9\">What is an IRS form W-9?</h3><p>When money is exchanged between two entities, taxes likely apply. When a business pays an employee, they deduct taxes on behalf of the employee who then files documentation to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) at the end of the year to prove that taxes have been paid. When money exchanges between a business and a vendor, it is up to the vendor to pay taxes owed to the government. The W-9 is a simple form that requires:</p><ul><li><strong>Name of Person or Name of Business.</strong> This is the title under which the person performs their service or labor. It may simply be the legal name of the person or a more formal business name or trade name (DBA name). That distinction is dependent on whether or not a business license is in place. The need for a business license will vary from region to region but is likely determined by level of liability and amount of annual earnings.</li><li><strong>Tax Identification Number (TIN): </strong>For each person or entity filing a tax return, there is a specific, unique number they should use so that the IRS can identify them. These include: Social Security Number, Employer Identification Number (EIN), Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN), Taxpayer Identification Number for Pending U.S. Adoptions (ATIN), Preparer Taxpayer Identification Number (PTIN). Providing the correct taxpayer identification number on this form is absolutely critical. When a vendor is working under their legal name, a social security number is provided on the W-9. Registered businesses, however, are assigned identifying numbers. For example, in Washington State, registered businesses are given a Universal Business Identifier (UBI). The basic format of the number is 9 digits long. However, it can be written in a 16 digit format, the additional 7 seven digits refer to Business ID and Business Location. These additional numbers are most relevant to businesses that have multiple locations.</li><li><strong>Business Type or Federal Tax Classification.</strong> Each type of business is subject to different taxes. These classifications are: individual, sole proprietorship, single-member LLC, C Corporation, S Corporation, Partnership, Limited Liability Company (LLC), and Trust/Estate.</li><li><strong>Business Contact Information.</strong> A mailing address is provided where a business can send form 1099-MISC or 1099-NEC at the end of the tax year.</li><li><strong>Any exemptions that apply.</strong> Some businesses or payments made are not subject to taxes. These exemptions have a code associated with them that should be filled out on the form. A business should assume that the exemptions are valid except where intimate knowledge of it being otherwise. Nonprofit organizations are an example of a tax-exempt vendor. Further, any businesses that are exempt from Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) withholding are able to provide an exempt payee code as well.</li></ul><h3 id=\"when-does-my-business-need-a-w-9-from-a-vendor\">When does my business need a W-9 from a vendor?</h3><p>Businesses are required to provide a 1099-MISC or 1099-NEC (as of 2020) to any vendor who receives payments totaling $600 or more over the course of the year for services whether or not a vendor has been asked for or provided a W-9 form. Year-end earnings are reported in this way, filed with IRS as well as sent to the vendor. The W-9 form aids in determining identifying information for a vendor and it is therefore best practice to request a W-9 from all vendors. </p><p><strong>Suggested reading</strong>: <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/whats-the-difference-between-1099-and-w2/\">What's the difference between a 1099 and a W2</a>?</p><p>For example, most payments for products or goods are not subject to this requirement, unless over $5,000, as well as some payments made to C or S Corporations.

Not only would that vendor be subject to penalties of perjury, this can be detrimental to a business if they work with a vendor who is not filing taxes. Should this situation occur, businesses are required to withhold 24% of payment, called backup withholding, to be filed to the IRS to help them identify non-compliant businesses.</p><h2 id=\"requesting-w-9-from-vendors-upfront-with-routable\">Requesting W-9 from vendors upfront with Routable</h2><p>Routable offers software that supports healthy business-to-business relationships. While obtaining W-9 information is just one step in having a <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/a-guide-to-vendor-management/\">successful vendor management</a> plan, the consequences of not having this W-9 information are far reaching.

            "html": "<p>Whether your business sells coffee by the cup or facilitates project management solutions, there are a variety of payment options and providers to consider. Below, we’ll go over the main payment methods available to small businesses and our recommended payment providers. </p><h2 id=\"small-business-payment-methods\">Small business payment methods</h2><h3 id=\"cash\">Cash</h3><p>Cash payments in the form of paper bills and coins have been used in the US for over 300 years. Many retail business owners continue the use of cash payments for immediate exchange of goods and currency. Cash payments are a secure, immediate method of payment that requires very little overhead to conduct business. Effective bookkeeping is enough to track incoming and outgoing payments. </p><p>When it comes to vendor payments (<a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/intro-to-b2b-payments/\">B2B payments</a>), businesses should be cautious of anyone requiring cash payment. This can be a sign that the business is operating in a way to avoid paying taxes. Alternatively, if accepting cash payments as a vendor, be aware that large cash deposits to banks can be a bit of a red flag for illegal activity. Further, some business owners are encouraged to deposit in smaller amounts to avoid the attention of the bank who is required to file a Currency Transaction Report for any deposits more than $10,000. However, this practice of “structuring” deposits is illegal and will draw the attention of the IRS.</p><h3 id=\"ach\">ACH</h3><p>Digital payments made using the Automated Clearing House are known as ACH payments. Direct deposit, tax refunds, government benefits payments—these examples of ACH payments demonstrate the security and efficiency of this payment option. ACH payments occur within small windows of time without the need for a trip to the bank or printing out checks. What is a benefit can also be a drawback. While ACH payments make pre-authorized, automated and batch payments a possibility, they do open the door to overpayment or overdraft fees. ACH payments are also subject to transaction fees. Learn more about <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/setting-up-ach-payments/\">setting up ACH payments for your business</a>. </p><h3 id=\"wire-transfer\">Wire Transfer</h3><p>“Wire” is an archaism from a time when transactions between banks required the use of telegraphs. A wire transfer is an electronic funds transfer (EFT) that enables a business owner to move or receive funds from their bank to another. Examples of this are Western Union or SWIFT that offer timely and international payment solutions. Wire transfers are subject to fees, sometimes upwards of $50 per transaction. Also, wire transfers can get lost and while, for a fee, these can be recovered, there is also the possibility that the funds are lost indefinitely. Learn more about the <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/ach-vs-wire-transfer-which-is-better-for-your-company/\">benefits and drawbacks of wire transfers</a> and how they compare to ACH. </p><h3 id=\"credit-card\">Credit Card</h3><p>A credit card is a rectangular piece of plastic that represents a line of credit that a bank has agreed to provide the holder of the card. In exchange, the holder of the card has agreed to terms for repayment including any interest that may apply. Businesses that accept credit card payments need a Point of Sale (POS) solution in place to process these card-present payments. Cost and upkeep of hardware can be barriers to making this a payment solution.</p><p>While payments made with a credit card simplify tracking dates, amounts, and recipients, credit cards are subject to credit limits and at times high annual percentage rates that can quickly turn into blocked payments and additional fees with your financial institution. Additionally, credit cards may be subject to interchange fees and/or monthly processing fees. To compensate for these fees, products or services may include a markup. Visa, Mastercard, and American Express are the most widely used and accepted credit card companies.</p><h3 id=\"check-payments\">Check payments</h3><p>A check is a piece of paper that includes features that identify the payer and payee and is used to initiate a transfer of funds at a financial institution. All checks include similar information: date, payee name, the amount the check is for both in numeric and written out, and a signature for validation. Checks often have a “memo” line where a PO or reference number can be written. Checks can’t be cashed by just anyone and may include advanced security options like holograms, watermarks, or a security coating. Checks also provide a paper trail and with the advent of online banking, payees may even be able to see scanned copies of checks they have paid within their bank account. Unfortunately, not everyone will accept a check, especially for payments that are already late or coming due soon because they take time to clear. </p><h3 id=\"contactless-payments\">Contactless payments</h3><p>Sometimes referred to as tap-and-go payment, contactless payment options make use of radio frequency identification (RFID) and near-field communication (NFC) technology to enable a payer to “tap” their credit or debit card for payment rather than swiping, entering a PIN number, or signing for a transaction. While this technology is highly beneficial at point of sale, there are still risks of fraud through the use of skimming devices and smartphone software that can record data from the magnetic strip of a card. </p><h2 id=\"best-payment-providers-for-small-businesses\">Best payment providers for small businesses</h2><h3 id=\"intuit-quickbooks-online\">Intuit QuickBooks Online</h3><p>Quickbooks and accounting have nearly become synonymous in the world of business.

On top of that, mistakes in invoices or transactions by bookkeepers can be not only costly, but can lead to negative customer service experiences. </p><p>Automation and artificial intelligence are paving the way for a new future for accounting teams. With technology handling repetitive tasks like manual data entry, your accounting department can focus on items that require human intervention, like vendor relations and communications. Integrating automation into your accounting system can significantly decrease human error and empower your accounting teams to put their time into more strategic projects.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-accounting-automation\">What is accounting automation?</h2><p>Accounting automation can take on a variety of roles depending on the platform you decide to use. Some solutions use AI (artificial intelligence), robotic process automation (RPA), optical character recognition (OCR), or predictive learning software that implements machine learning. Through any combination of these mechanisms, you can do things such as automate parts of your AP bill processing, approval processes, reconciliation, and AR invoicing. These processes become streamlined to do any tedious number-crunching instantly while notifying the correct parties throughout the workflow process. The purpose of these programs isn't to put accounting professionals out of work but to help them focus on much more critical tasks like analysis and human points of contact. This technological change helps your company improve customer service with vendors, improve audit accuracy, assist with data analytics and data accuracy, and prevent fraud.</p><h2 id=\"why-are-companies-embracing-accounting-automation\">Why are companies embracing accounting automation?</h2><p>Automation tools are bringing innovation to the accounting profession. Along with empowering finance professionals, there are several compelling reasons for business owners and CFOs to add automation to their offices. From productivity, to ease of rollout, let's take a look at some of the significant benefits.</p><h3 id=\"manual-accounting-is-time-consuming\">Manual accounting is time-consuming</h3><p>Many accounting tasks are tedious and time-consuming, especially when done completely manually. From formatting Microsoft Excel spreadsheets to manual journal entries, tedious number-checking and data entry can take up most of an accountant's day. While this work is important, inputting financial information by hand is far from the most important way that employees can create impact. Automating some of these manual finance functions gives your team space to spend time on important human points of contact and complex analytics. This change in focus from the repetitive to the more intricate can cause a massive productivity transformation for the department.</p><h3 id=\"manual-accounting-has-too-many-data-entry-issues\">Manual accounting has too many data entry issues</h3><p>Human error  is a considerable problem with manual data entry. These mistakes don't make it past auditors, and workplace bank accounts can suffer from even minor mistakes. Along with all these problems, it can lead to relationship issues with suppliers and skew financial data. These are some serious issues that automation easily resolves, ensuring accuracy while also completing tasks much quicker. Keeping your general ledger accurate helps analytics and cash flow reports reflect accurate data and saves your company from potential trouble.</p><h3 id=\"accountants-are-spending-too-much-time-on-non-productive-tasks\">Accountants are spending too much time on non-productive tasks</h3><p>At the end of the week, when looking at your time-tracking, the last thing you want to see is that you spent all week just doing data entry catchup. Unfortunately, this isn't an uncommon occurrence, but these low-value tasks still need to be done to keep up with financials. This time can be better used for more critical and valuable work when using accounting automation to overtake routine tasks. By creating this space in your team's time, they can focus more on projects that require analysis and problem-solving.</p><h3 id=\"automation-is-easier-to-implement-than-ever-before\">Automation is easier to implement than ever before</h3><p>Introducing new software to your team may sound like a headache. However, more recent automation programs integrate seamlessly with your current accounting software and can even help you manage it. By using two-way syncing, you can keep your main accounting program updated to the latest version. You can even import settings from your software if compatible and make reconciliation less manual.</p><h2 id=\"other-benefits-of-accounting-automation\">Other benefits of accounting automation</h2><p>While the above reasons are all great benefits to accounting automation, they aren't the only reasons they have caught the eyes of financial teams and CFOs. There are many other benefits to these tools that survey respondents often cite and huge boons to their teams.</p><h3 id=\"save-more-time-with-compliance-work\">Save more time with compliance work</h3><p>While data entry and bookkeeping may seem the most straightforward areas for automation, many companies are beginning to use automation for compliance as well. Technology has automated tracking and reporting so that compliance is no longer a daily stressor for your team. This assistance is vital for so many reasons, including keeping your company safe. It is also another area where you start to see significant time savings for your team once automated.</p><h3 id=\"improve-communication\">Improve communication</h3><p>Automation tools that integrate with your existing systems can help internal communications with your stakeholders. Through customizable approval rules, many programs streamline internal communication and the approval process entirely. You can easily see when a payment or invoice has been approved by the requested parties, making it easier for you to track.</p><p>Automated communications workflows can also improve communications with clients. You can easily onboard new clients, send invoices, and create a more transparent experience for your customers. This can help you get your bills paid faster and develop a positive relationship with your customers.</p><h3 id=\"fewer-issues-with-incorrect-data\">Fewer issues with incorrect data</h3><p>Human error is inevitable. Unfortunately, that can be a massive deal in accounting. One extra number or swapped digit can cause a cascade of problems for your company and your relationship with clients. If your team is inputting large amounts of data manually, you're bound to introduce human error. While there are ways to prevent this from happening (a second reviewer, or manual audits), these methods are extremely time-consuming. Automated data entry helps your company reduce this risk and save valuable time. </p><h3 id=\"cloud-access\">Cloud access</h3><p>Many company storage systems, such as document management systems, are beginning to move to the cloud. Storing and securing things locally is slowly becoming a thing of the past and is often outdated and unsafe. Many accounting automation platforms are now cloud-integrated, which are more secure. </p><h3 id=\"integrations-with-your-accounting-and-erp-tools\">Integrations with your accounting and ERP tools</h3><p>Accounting automation tools can usually sync and integrate with your accounting tools and your enterprise resource planning (ERP) tools. This compatibility allows for seamless communication between your platforms, syncing settings between these tools, and other benefits. These features help make the transition and automation software integration much more painless.</p><h2 id=\"which-accounting-tasks-should-be-automated\">Which accounting tasks should be automated?</h2><p>We've discussed data entry, bookkeeping, and compliance work that can be automated, but what specific workflows are often automated? There are a handful of different ways this kind of technology can assist your team depending on your needs, but here are a few examples of how many companies utilize these tools.</p><h3 id=\"purchasing-and-procurement\">Purchasing and procurement</h3><p>From handling purchase order forms, approval reminders, and purchase requisition forms, there are many parts of this process that can be streamlined with automation.</p><h3 id=\"travel-and-mileage-reimbursement\">Travel and mileage reimbursement</h3><p>Employee travel and mileage reimbursements are also easy to automate. There are many tools available that can help create, send, and approve forms through a streamlined, automatic workflow. This technology can help save a ton of time while also reducing the potential for fraud in your company.</p><h3 id=\"expense-reports\">Expense reports</h3><p>Expense reporting is frustrating not only for the accounting department but for managers and employees. Through a clear, easy approval and reporting process guided by automation, you can cut down on the time it takes for both the accounting team and employees.</p><h3 id=\"accounts-receivable\">Accounts receivable</h3><p>One of the most significant accounting tasks that are often automated is receivables. Some programs have tools that allow you to accept online payments, easily route your invoices, and connect these transactions directly with your accounting software. These tools help you spend less time on your invoicing by automating the process and allowing for bulk invoicing.</p><h3 id=\"sales-order-process\">Sales order process</h3><p>Often abbreviated as SOA, sales order automation is a huge benefit to a sales and accounting team. It helps keep communication tight between these divisions and ensures that information isn't forgotten or left out throughout the process. This kind of automation allows sales to go through quicker and for teams to quickly finish the entire sales workflow cycle.</p><h3 id=\"payroll\">Payroll</h3><p>While already automated by many companies, payroll is an easy place where your company can save a ton of time for multiple teams through automation practices. It ensures employees are paid accurately and on time, preventing frustrating mishaps that can cause internal issues.</p><h3 id=\"invoice-auditing\">Invoice auditing</h3><p>Invoice auditing software such as <a href=\"https://openenvoy.com/\">OpenEnvoy</a> can automatically detect if an invoice total or line item doesn’t match the purchase order or estimate it was billed against and notify you, saving money and giving you more control over your cash flow.</p><h3 id=\"monthly-closes\">Monthly closes</h3><p>Closing books can be time-consuming, but this process can be expedited through automation. Monthly closes is a project that will occur consistently and often and has plenty of repetitive steps that can take a ton of time to complete. For these reasons, it is a great place to cut down on manual interference to save time for your team.</p><h2 id=\"what-to-look-for-with-automated-accounting-software\">What to look for with automated accounting software</h2><p>So, your team has decided to start looking into automation options.

In this blog post, we’ll cover the basics of B2B payments, including common challenges that teams face throughout their workflow and how modern B2B payment solutions solve them.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-a-b2b-payment\">What is a B2B payment?</h2><p>A B2B (business-to-business) payment is the purchase of goods or services from one business to another business or from one business to a contingent worker (e.g., freelancers, consultants, independent contractors). These payments are often recurring transactions under contractual terms or can occur on a one-time basis.</p><p>B2B payment examples vary widely and can include:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><ul>\n  <li>A ride-share app paying every single one of its many drivers</li>\n  <li>A startup paying its email software provider</li>\n  <li>A car repair shop paying its vendors for unique parts</li>\n  <li>An e-commerce store paying its international partners for inventory</li>\n</ul><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>There is no one method in which these payments are made, and they range from traditional paper checks to <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/how-electronic-payments-work/\">electronic payment</a> methods.</p><h2 id=\"b2b-payment-methods\">B2B payment methods</h2><p>B2B payment methods can have positive or negative impacts to the payment life cycle depending on which you choose. Transaction fees can add up over time, and payment delays can have serious repercussions for your cash flow. Plus, there’s the security of your transaction to consider. Below, you’ll find brief explainers of various B2B payment methods along with a few pros and cons of each.</p><p><strong>Suggested reading</strong>: <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/small-business-payment-methods/\">Small Business Payment Options</a></p><h3 id=\"credit-cards\">Credit cards</h3><p>Credit cards are most common in business-to-customer transactions (i.e., paying a restaurant for your meal or paying an online store for your order). There are plenty of credit card providers out there (like the well-known Mastercard and Visa), and processing fees vary depending on the <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/small-business/credit-card-processing-fees\">transaction method and rates</a> for each card. Payment volumes between businesses are higher than those made by consumers, which means processing fees can add up quickly. For this reason, credit cards haven’t been popular for B2B transactions.</p><h3 id=\"ach-payments\">ACH payments </h3><p>ACH payments are electronic payments that go through an Automated Clearing House Network, which is managed by a non-profit called the National Automated Clearing House Association (<a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/what-is-nacha/\">Nacha</a>). They are often referred to as <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/what-is-an-ach-direct-deposit/\">ACH direct deposit</a> payments, e-checks or direct pay. Many businesses prefer to <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/setting-up-ach-payments/\">accept ACH payments</a> due to their level of high security and the quickness in which they’re completed, arriving in usually about one to three business days. In terms of fees, they cost less than $1, which offers significant savings compared to credit cards.</p><h3 id=\"wire-transfers\">Wire transfers</h3><p>Wire transfers are typically used when moving a significant sum of money to someone you know well. With wire transfers, money goes straight from the buyer's bank to the seller's bank before ending up in their business account. Wire transfers are generally considered to be safe, but they can be pricey: Fees can reach up to $50 per transaction, depending on your bank's policy. </p><p><strong>Suggested reading</strong>: <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/ach-vs-wire-transfer-which-is-better-for-your-company/\">ACH vs Wire Transfer</a></p><h3 id=\"payment-aggregators\">Payment aggregators</h3><p>You've likely used a <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/what-is-a-payment-aggregator/\">payment aggregator</a> like Paypal or Square. They are popular because payments can be made quickly and their checkout processes are easy to use. These platforms are much more common in P2P (peer-to-peer) transactions (e.g., paying a friend back for lunch) due to their user-friendly interfaces, but businesses also use them for payment processing. Each platform has its own fees and constraints. For example, many businesses instead end up looking for a <a href=\"https://routable.com/best-paypal-alternative\">Paypal alternative</a> due to the platform’s feature limitations, such as lack of mass payments, accounting software integrations and bill approval workflows.</p><h3 id=\"checks\">Checks</h3><p>Paper checks are familiar, flexible and reliable for many business owners, making them a popular method for B2B payments. But they’re not perfect. Purchasing checks can get expensive and manually processing them can be a burden on an accounting team depending on the volume.</p><p><strong>Suggested reading</strong>: <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/ach-vs-check/\">ACH vs Check</a></p><p>Additionally, checks can take several days to arrive to the recipient, and there's a risk they can get lost in the mail. There’s also an inconvenience placed on the recipient if they don’t use mobile banking to deposit their check; they’ll have to visit a bank in person to process the payment. </p><h3 id=\"eft\">EFT</h3><p>EFT stands for Electronic Fund Transfer and refers to the electronic movement of money from one bank account to another. An <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/eft-payments/\">EFT payment method</a> isn’t actually considered a payment method per se. Instead, it’s an all-encompassing term used to describe a range of electronic payments, like the ones we described above (wire transfers, credit cards and Paypal). EFTs are fast, reliable and easy to track, making them a good choice for B2B payments.</p><h2 id=\"the-top-challenges-of-b2b-payments\">The top challenges of B2B payments</h2><p>B2B transactions are riddled with complications, but you can overcome them with careful planning and <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/what-is-payment-automation/\">payment automation</a> solutions (more on this in the following section). Here are some common challenges and how they affect business and accounting teams.</p><h3 id=\"everyone-has-their-preferred-b2b-payment-method\">Everyone has their preferred B2B payment method</h3><p>While you may have a particular payment method that you prefer using, it doesn't mean that all the businesses you work with will want to use the same one. For example, you may favor ACH transactions, but your trade partner is adamant about digital payment platforms. To facilitate this, your accounting department will have to be flexible to your clients' needs to the best of your abilities.</p><h3 id=\"scaling-payments-gets-messy\">Scaling payments gets messy</h3><p>An accounts payable team can manage a few hundred payments per month. But when those payments reach the thousands (or even up to 500, really), mistakes and delays occur. Most tasks throughout B2B payment processing are done manually (e.g., data entry and reviewing) so it’s not surprising that challenges only increase for a team when payments start scaling; there’s so much more data and paperwork to track.</p><h3 id=\"cross-border-b2b-payments-are-slow-and-expensive\">Cross-border B2B payments are slow and expensive</h3><p><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/cross-border-payments-guide/\">Cross-border B2B payments</a> (also known as international payments or sometimes <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/what-is-payment-remittance/\">payment remittance</a>) can be a burden on businesses due to the added expenses and planning:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><ul>\n  <li>Can the vendor be paid their local currency?</li>\n  <li>Are payments trackable as they move across borders?</li>\n  <li>Is there awareness around country-specific compliance laws and regulations?</li>\n</ul><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The number of touch points a B2B payment undergoes only increases as it moves internationally.

But when\nthose payments reach the thousands (or even up to 500, really), mistakes and\ndelays occur. Most tasks throughout B2B payment processing are done manually\n(e.g., data entry and reviewing) so it’s not surprising that challenges only\nincrease for a team when payments start scaling; there’s so much more data and\npaperwork to track.\n\nCross-border B2B payments are slow and expensive\nCross-border B2B payments\n[https://blog.routable.com/cross-border-payments-guide/] (also known as\ninternational payments or sometimes payment remittance\n[https://blog.routable.com/what-is-payment-remittance/]) can be a burden on\nbusinesses due to the added expenses and planning:\n\n * Can the vendor be paid their local currency?\n * Are payments trackable as they move across borders?\n * Is there awareness around country-specific compliance laws and regulations?\n\nThe number of touch points a B2B payment undergoes only increases as it moves\ninternationally. Managing this manually can be exhausting for accounting teams.\n\nSuggested reading: Paying International Contractors\n[https://blog.routable.com/how-to-pay-international-contractors-and-freelancers/]\n\nIncreased risk of fraud\nB2B payments have been increasingly experiencing payment fraud\n[https://blog.routable.com/how-to-avoid-payment-fraud/], and it’s a trend that\nisn’t going away. According to a survey by the Association of Financial\nProfessionals\n[https://www.jpmorgan.com/solutions/treasury-payments/insights/payments-fraud-and-cybersecurity-trends-to-watch]\n, nearly 75% of businesses say they were targets of an attempted attack or\nactual payments fraud in 2020. The report also points out that compromised\nemails are the primary source of attacks.\n\nA few reasons for so much fraud\n[https://www.dnb.com/perspectives/finance-credit-risk/types-of-business-fraud.html]\n: Over the pandemic, many storefronts went digital and teams shifted to remote\nwork, opening up payment processing to vulnerabilities.\n\nLack of visibility\nIt’s crucial to make each B2B transaction as transparent as possible, but it’s\nall too common to receive vague documentation without a detailed breakdown of\ncharges. And poor communication between businesses also occurs frequently.\n\nFluctuations in processing time\nMany factors can cause delays in B2B payment processing. For one, paperwork\noften has to go through both accounting departments, waiting for various\napprovals before moving forward. The type of payment used can stall the process,\ntoo. Mailing a check, for example, can take significantly longer than using\nelectronic payment methods. This variability means that even recurring orders\naren't always processed at the same time each month, which can make some\ntransactions unpredictable.\n\nHow B2B payment solutions alleviate these issues\nCompanies implement B2B payment solutions (sometimes called a B2B payment system\nor B2B payment service) to avoid these common processing issues. Solutions with\nrobust tools (particularly automation) help keep payments secure while also\ncutting down on an accounting department's tedious manual work. Benefits you may\nexperience from adopting B2B payment services include:\n\nImprove cash flow\nDelayed and inconsistent transactions with other businesses can dramatically\nimpact your cash flow. Paying bills on time and getting your invoices paid by\ntheir due date is crucial, but piles of paperwork and other complexities can\nslow these processes. By implementing a B2B payment solution, you can process\nthese payments through the platform itself, accepting online payments and paying\nbills through an easy interface. Doing this not only provides an automated paper\ntrail and notifies you upon payment receipt, but it also helps streamline the\nworkflow between you and your partners.\n\nSimplified workflows via integrations with your accounting software\nB2B payment services often connect directly to your accounting software to\nautomate invoicing, data entry and bulk processing. These centralized platforms\nmay also allow you to email, upload or scan bills for more manageable payment\nand tracking. With everything being accurately processed in the same way,\nbookkeeping and taxes become more straightforward since you aren't searching for\nmissing invoices in your cluttered email inbox.\n\nIncreased security\nSolutions offer tight security with encryption for each B2B payment. And due to\nthe detailed paper trail kept within many of these platforms, you'll be able to\neasily refute the transaction if fraud occurs.\n\nTeams can focus on more meaningful projects\nAccounting teams spend too much time on manual, tedious work. Automation\nstreamlines most of this work to add hours to your team’s workweek. Teams can\nfocus on tasks that require a human touch (i.e., vendor relationships and\nanalysis) rather than wasting time on data entry.\n\nWhat to look for in a B2B payment solution\nBefore evaluating B2B payments companies and their platforms, talk to your team\nfirst. Along with awareness around what your business needs as a whole (i.e.,\ngrowth), set aside time to understand your team’s frustrations with day-to-day\nwork and how a new tool could solve their concerns.The following features may be\napplicable to those conversations:\n\nAutomation \nWe’ve talked quite a bit about automation throughout this blog post because its\naddition to your B2B payment setup will support your team and the greater\nbusiness in multiple ways. By automating the accounts payable cycle\n[https://blog.routable.com/accounts-payable-process/] with a B2B payment\nsolution, teams streamline their workflows, accelerate payment processing times\nand strengthen data accuracy (just to name a few).\n\nIntegrations with accounting tools\nSome B2B payment services integrate seamlessly with your existing accounting\nsoftware, which makes the transition to a new technology much more accessible\nsince your team can continue working with familiar tools. Some options can even\nkeep your software updated to ensure flawless integration throughout all of your\nproducts.\n\nEase of use\nWhen implementing completely new technology to your team, ease of use is key.\nB2B payment services are supposed to make your team's job easier, so as you\ndecide which product you want to use, make sure that the platform's\nimplementation and workflow are simple, quick and empowering for your team.\n\nMass payouts to scale with your business\nLook for a platform that offers mass payouts [https://routable.com/mass-payouts] \nto manage your scaling payments. This is an essential functionality to automate\nvendor and supplier onboarding, payment initiation and cross-border payouts at\nscale. It’s also the best way to pay contractors\n[https://blog.routable.com/best-way-to-pay-1099-contractors/] and other\ncontingent works at scale.\n\nAnd if you’re not processing a high-volume of payments just yet, consider it a\nform of future-proofing: You don't want to have to purchase another platform\nwhen your business grows.\n\nUse Routable to simplify your B2B payments\nRoutable simplifies any B2B transaction by accepting online payments, automating\ninvoice payments and sending real-time notifications every step along the way.\nWith integrated automation tools and direct connections with your current\naccounting software, Routable can help your team spend less time invoicing and\n safely collect payments no matter how many you send.\n\nAutomated accounts payable\nRoutable simplifies your accounts payable process.

            "plaintext": "According to an American Bankers Association\n[https://www.aba.com/news-research/research-analysis/deposit-account-fraud-survey-report] \nstudy, check fraud was 47% ($1.3 billion) of all industry deposit account fraud.\nThere are many ways to keep your company safe from counterfeit checks through\ndifferent fraud detection methods, with positive pay being one of them. If you\nare looking for fraud protection for your company from identity thieves,\nfraudsters, and over-the-counter fraud, it is worth looking into the positive\npay concept.\n\nFraud losses are a severe issue, and it is a company's responsibility to protect\nyourself from exposure to criminals. Investing in a fraud-prevention system can\ngive you peace of mind during your transactions regardless of the dollar amount.\nPositive pay is a great option that many trust and is worth considering to help\nadd security checks against fraudulent items like counterfeit checks.\n\nWhat is positive pay?\nSimply put, positive pay is a type of automated fraud detection technology that\nmany commercial banks offer. There are also ACH positive pay options. It is a\nform of insurance against any bank liabilities and is considered an automated\ncash management service. It examines the presented checks for payment with the\ninitial company-issued checks. It will catch if there is even a slight  problem\nand notify the issuer of suspicious transactions. It checks things like the\ndollar amount of each check to ensure that there isn't any variation or evidence\nof fraud.\n\nHow does positive pay work?\nPositive pay works by comparing a file of issued checks from a company to the\nchecks as they are presented at the bank for payment. This document is called a\ncheck-issue file. It looks at things like the check amount to look for\nsuspicious items and variations in the checks. Some systems even can check for\npayee name suspects. There are a couple of steps in the positive pay process to\nhelp it run smoothly.\n\nPreventing check and electronic payment fraud\nIn order to prevent fraud, the automated positive pay system continuously\nmonitors your issued check file against transmitted checks. There are a few ways\nthis technology does this, such as by checking the dollar amounts, check number,\nand sometimes the payee name. This service is a continual monitoring device, and\nwhile often there is a fee, it is similar to the importance of an email blocking\nscam items. It is there to offer peace of mind and to protect you in case fraud\nis attempted.\n\nCheck verification\nIf something doesn't seem right, the bank will contact your company. This\ncommunication varies from a fax of the image of the exception item to a call\nduring typical Monday to Friday business hours. You can then verify that the\ncheck can be accepted and cleared or reject it as a fraudulent check.\n\nDo your business need positive pay?\nWith over 80% of organizations reporting being targets of a payments fraud\nattack according to the 2020 AFP Payments Fraud and Control Survey\n[https://dynamic.afponline.org/paymentsfraud/p/2], the second-highest percentage\non record since 2009, now is time to act. If your company uses checks, it is\nessential to consider ways to protect yourself against fraud. Some companies,\nhowever, have moved to all virtual payments, in which case this may not be a\nsolution worth investment.\n\nWhen looking at positive pay as a solution, something to consider is the work\ninvolved in creating a check-issue file. It is crucial for your company to get\nthis sent; if the bank doesn't get it, all of the checks you have sent out for\nthe week may be automatically rejected. While this isn't a totally unmanageable\ntask, and some accounting software can assist you with the process, it is\nsomething to think about when making the change.\n\nWhat is reverse positive pay?\nThere is another version of positive pay called reverse positive pay. This\nprocess is often a more budget option that requires more work on the end of your\ncompany. In this method, your company has to monitor its own checks through a\nlist presented by the bank. If there is an issue, you must notify the bank if\nthey need to reject a check. The risk with this method is that if you take too\nlong to inform the bank or human error causes your team to miss a fraudulent\ncheck, you will still pay out the check amount.\n\nReverse positive pay can be a good option for companies that don't use a lot of\nchecks. It also is an excellent alternative for a company that doesn't want to\npay the potential fees of a positive pay system but has the workforce to handle\nreverse positive pay. Regardless of what you eventually pick, you can consider\nboth of these solutions to detecting check fraud.\n\nConclusion\nWith how common check fraud is, it is essential to protect your company. By\ntaking steps to prevent fraud, you can save your team and your company many\nheadaches in the form of lost money and legal fees. Contact your bank today to\nsee how you can implement positive pay or reverse positive pay and see if your\naccounting software helps facilitate these systems.",

It’s important to remember that this was nearly 2 years before our first serious round of funding and we had to be choosy about where we spent our time and effort. </p><p>Surfacing our internal APIs and modeling was a great way to get this product out to market quickly, test for product-market fit, and (most importantly) deliver value to our customers.</p><p>But <a href=\"https://tyk.io/your-data-model-is-not-an-api/\">our data model is not an API</a> and this approach isn’t scaling with us as we, or our developer partners, grow.</p><h3 id=\"the-routable-data-model\">The Routable data model</h3><blockquote>For new hires at Routable, learning our data model is a requirement. For new API customers, learning our data model is an imposition. </blockquote><p>Our data model is heavily influenced by the internal details of our application and the evolution of our product. It’s been built from the ground up to support all the features and functionality you’ll find in our dashboard application: CSV imports, matching vendors and customers with your accounting software, and managing your team and their roles.</p><p>In a way, you can think of the Routable dashboard as an abstraction layer on top of our data model.

At best, an API that isn’t meeting those expectations is no longer a value add for the business. At worst, it’s a net negative.</p><p>A key component of a stable, reliable API is managing change, and when you are exposing your internal data model it is difficult to do just that. To deliver new features to our customers like international payments and contact management, we make big, bold changes to our internal data model. These changes can be a problem for API users that are looking for a stable platform to integrate with.</p><p>We’ve done our best to insulate our API customers from these changes while supporting new product development – but ultimately, delivery velocity is slowed down for both dashboard and API users.</p><h3 id=\"missing-incomplete-or-inaccurate-documentation\">Missing, incomplete or inaccurate documentation</h3><p>One piece of feedback we’ve heard loud and clear from our customers is that we need to improve on our documentation.</p><p>As part of our commitment to doing better, we launched our <a href=\"https://developers.routable.com/docs\">developer portal</a> on <a href=\"https://readme.com/\">Readme</a> at the end of March. Readme is a powerful partner which allows us to consolidate all of our guides, tutorials, and best practices in one place.</p><blockquote>Reference guides have one job only: to describe. They are code-determined, because ultimately that’s what they describe: key classes, functions, APIs, and so they should list things like functions, fields, attributes and methods, and set out how to use them.<br>– <a href=\"https://diataxis.fr/reference/\">Diátaxis Framework</a></blockquote><p>We knew we needed to take a big step forward with our <a href=\"https://diataxis.fr/reference/\">reference documentation</a> and in order to deliver the best product possible we needed a way to generate our reference documentation from an OpenAPI specification.</p><p>We use <a href=\"https://jsonapi.org/\">JSON:API</a> because our dashboard benefits from the denormalized data and our team benefits from its <a href=\"https://bikeshed.org/\">anti-bikeshedding</a> properties. It helps us move fast and it’s a great specification for building APIs.</p><p>Unfortunately, JSON:API is notoriously difficult to describe with OpenAPI (at least in a way that’s understandable for end-users). We’ve also heard feedback that our implementation of it is not particularly amenable to integrating with existing JSON:API clients. </p><p>Taking both of these factors into account, we decided to retire JSON:API on our public facing API. This gave us a clear path forward to leveraging OpenAPI and riding the modern API development wave.</p><h2 id=\"how\">How?</h2><p>Now that we’ve covered the reasons <em>why</em> we’re making this change, let’s dive into <em>how</em> we’re making this change. The <em>how</em> here is really important, because without making changes to how we do things, we’re not likely to deliver on our goals. Like most ambitious projects in software development, it takes a dash of process and a little bit of technology to land smoothly.</p><h3 id=\"design-driven-development\">Design-driven development</h3><p>As developers, we were very interested in code first workflows where you build the API first and then generate an OpenAPI specification from the code post-implementation. After a number of prototypes with different technologies and stacks, we realized code first just doesn’t work very well for your needs as API consumers or our needs as API experience engineers.</p><p>With a code first approach, we found ourselves creating awkward APIs with incomplete auto-generated OpenAPI specifications. To bring these documents up to par, we had to jump through various hoops, either hooking into framework internals or post processing the generated yaml. Yuck.</p><p>O<em>nce again</em> we were exposing internal implementation details to our end users. If we renamed a class, moved it to another module, or changed the class hierarchy, a different model definition was generated in our OpenAPI specification. We knew this was going to cause problems even for our own internal use as we moved towards using these specification documents to jumpstart SDK development.</p><p>Additionally, with a code first workflow in a dynamic language like Python or Node, you have the flexibility to do all sorts of wild and crazy things with your API request and response models. If you do go wild and crazy, you tend to deliver APIs with inconsistencies, awkward usage patterns and sharp edges that make it difficult to build clients against.</p><p>Instead, we embraced <a href=\"https://stoplight.io/api-development/\">design-driven API development</a> –a process where we describe the APIs in an OpenAPI specification <em>before</em> we start writing code. The benefits have been tremendous.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/05/apisyouwonthate.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"519\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2021/05/apisyouwonthate.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2021/05/apisyouwonthate.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2021/05/apisyouwonthate.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2021/05/apisyouwonthate.png 2236w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"><figcaption>Original flowchart borrowed (with permission) from Phil Sturgeon</figcaption></figure><p>Working within the constraints of OpenAPI tends to drive an API towards simple rather than complex.</p><p>We’re able to frontload much of our reference documentation.

We’re excited to use this functionality in the future to streamline SDK testing in our CI/CD pipelines. In addition, we can benefit from code generation on both the client and server.</p><p>It’s even improved our security posture: best practices are baked in directly to our process. For example, we’re reviewing and carefully defining schemas for all our responses, explicitly specifying all the parameters and payloads we’re expecting, and validating all this at runtime. All of these practices are considered effective prevention methods for multiple entries of the <a href=\"https://apisecurity.io/encyclopedia/content/owasp/owasp-api-security-top-10\">OWASP API Security Top 10</a> list including excessive data exposure, mass assignment, and injection.</p><p>When your OpenAPI spec becomes the single point of truth for your API, it brings much needed clarity and stability to your API development processes.</p><h3 id=\"the-stack\">The stack</h3><p>So, we’d be remiss to skip talking about the technology that enables us here.

Not only are we going all in on OpenAPI, we’re going all in on types!</p><p>And on the tooling side, we’re deep into the Node ecosystem and leveraging multiple technologies to help us write our descriptions, including <a href=\"https://stoplight.io/open-source/spectral/\">Spectral</a> for linting, <a href=\"https://stoplight.io/open-source/prism\">Prism</a> for mocking, and <a href=\"https://redoc.ly/openapi-cli/\">openapi-cli</a> for previewing as we write.</p><p>Let’s see how this all works together in concert to optimize our internal developer experience so we can produce the best possible external developer experience.</p><h4 id=\"docs-and-mocks\">Docs and mocks</h4><p>When writing our openapi documentation, we run <code>openapi preview-docs</code> to start up a redoc watch server.

As part of our first specification draft, we actually built out a mini\nSDK to validate the interfaces!\n\nroutable = Routable(\"http://127.0.0.1:4010/v1\", header={\"Authorization\": \"Bearer 12345\"})\n\n# Create a Vendor\nvance_refrigeration = routable.companies.create(\n    contacts=[\n        {\n            \"email\": \"bob@vancerefrigeration.com\",\n            \"first_name\": \"Bob\",\n            \"last_name\": \"Vance\",\n            \"phone_number\": \"+14155552671\",\n        }\n    ],\n    is_vendor=True,\n    name=\"Vance Refrigeration\",\n    type=\"business\",\n)\n\n# Add a bank account\npayable_account = routable.companies(vance_refrigeration.hid).payable_accounts.create(\n    bank={\"account_number\": \"9876543210\", \"routing_number\": \"015539113\", \"type\": \"checking\"},\n    headers={\"Prefer\": \"example=Bank\"},\n)\n\n# Send an Invite on Kevin's behalf\nkevin = routable.settings.team_members(email=\"kevin@dundermifflin.com\").results[0]\n\nroutable.companies(vance_refrigeration.hid).invite.create(\n    acting_team_member=kevin.hid, message=\"<strong>Please accept this invitation ASAP</strong>\"\n)\n\nAn early SDK prototypeSimplifying code and tests\nWhere the magic really begins is when we use our specification to drive code\ngeneration and testing examples.\n\nOn the code generation side, we use datamodel-code-generator\n[https://github.com/koxudaxi/datamodel-code-generator] to generate incoming\nrequest and outgoing response models for our FastAPI project. This ensures that\nthe data coming in and leaving our API is always in compliance with our\nspecification and in turn our documentation. This is great from both a developer\nexperience perspective and security perspective.\n\nOn the testing side, we use the examples in our OpenAPI specification to drive\nour end-to-end tests, ensuring that our examples are always accurate and\nfunctional for developers integrating with our API.\n\n def test_personal_vendor_company_flow(self, acting_team_member_id, example_loader, faker, client):\n        name_uuid = str(uuid4())\n        create_request = example_loader(\"companies/create-company-personal\")\n        create_request[\"acting_team_member\"] = acting_team_member_id\n        create_request[\"contacts\"][0][\"email\"] = str(uuid4())[0:6] + faker.email()\n        create_request[\"external_id\"] = str(uuid4())\n        create_request[\"name\"] += f\" [{name_uuid}]\"\n\n        # Can create a new company\n        create_response = client.post(\"/v1/companies\", json=create_request)\n        assert create_response.status_code == 201\n        create_json = create_response.json()\n\n        # Retrieve it\n        retrieve_response = client.get(f'/v1/companies/{create_json[\"id\"]}')\n        assert retrieve_response.status_code == 200\n        retrieve_json = retrieve_response.json()\n        assert retrieve_json == create_json\n\nExamples that drive our tests - a virtuous cycleWhen?\nThis sounds awesome, right? “When can I get access?!” you say? We’re still\nfinalizing our release timelines here but we’re aiming to have beta access\navailable for new and existing customers in the coming months. We’ll keep you\nposted.\n\nIf you’re an engineer reading this and think this sounds awesome, drop us a line\nat developers@routable.com and check out our careers page to join our awesome\nteam.",

This technology also allows your team to face any level of\nscalability that your company needs without it being as daunting - processing\n100 invoices instead of a dozen is a lot more surmountable when automation is\ninvolved.\n\nAs your employees save time and start giving human touches to more important\nprocesses, you will see improvement in things like supplier relations, analysis,\nand error-detection. On top of this time saved, automation cuts down on human\nerror from manual entry and speeds up processing time, saving money for the\ncompany. You will see not only higher efficiency, but a team that feels that\nthey are able to accomplish more high-quality work without added stress.\n\n3. Look for integrations with your existing accounting software\nYou can easily implement some payable automation software through seamless\nintegration with your accounting systems or ERP systems. When planning on making\nthe transition to accounting software, get a list of the essential tools already\nbeing used by your financial team. Examine which of these tools your team enjoys\nand uses often, and which they would like to see replaced. Some automation\nprograms offer replacements for certain functionality, allowing you to not only\nintegrate existing software but replace outdated processes.\n\nOnce you discover which programs are most important for your team's success, you\ncan look for compatible software. By ensuring that there is integration within\nthe new software, you will make the transition period easier as well. It will\nnot only reduce stress for your team in navigating a whole new suite of tools,\nbut will save your company time and money spent on training for the new\nproducts. This intersection will also help your department work together\nseamlessly regardless of the operation or data analysis project.\n\n4. Include automated tax form collection\nA considerable benefit of accounting software is automated tax form collection.\nBy cutting down on this usually manual and arduous task, you save yourself money\nand your team time. The tedious, manual job of checking and double checking tax\ninformation and accuracy can be a huge undertaking that can easily be replaced\nby a robust automation system. Your team will have the peace of mind around tax\nseason that their work won't double or triple.\n\nAutomating this portion of your accounting is a prime example of replacing a\ntask where human error can be extremely costly and risky for the company. One\nsmall data entry mistake can lead to legal and financial trouble. Implementing\nthese tools protects your company and allows for mistakes to be easily caught\nbefore they cause your company issues. Keep an eye out for software with OCR\nrecognition as well, which is vital in many areas but specifically helpful with\ntax forms and invoices.\n\n5. Opt for cloud-based software instead of on-premise hosted software\nThe cloud is the future for many reasons. Cloud-based software is often more\nsecure than on-premise software, something that absolutely must be considered\nwith financial data. Consider the risks associated with any on-premise data\nhosting, such as lost data due to server damage and security breaches. Many\ncloud-based software companies ensure top-end security measures, and can do so\nat a much lower cost than you can.\n\nIn addition, on-premise hosting is often expensive and requires consistent\nupgrading and maintenance to ensure that everything is up-to-date. This price\ntag doesn't just include security measures, but also physical hardware needed to\nhost some on-premise programs. If a server is needed to store the data, prices\ncan skyrocket quite quickly. Cloud-based software gives you peace of mind and\ncan save you money in the long run.\n\nHow Routable's accounts payable software can help\nRoutable [https://routable.com/payables] is a flexible, scalable solution that\nemphasizes top-tier automation capabilities with sophisticated API tools.

Freelance designers can be hired to revamp a website in time for a new product line. Independent contractors will pack up, break down, and reassemble warehouse shelving when a business moves. If you have been thinking about hiring a freelancer or independent contractor, get to know what those terms mean and what responsibilities and options exist for you.</p><h2 id=\"worker-classifications-and-tax-implications\">Worker classifications and tax implications</h2><h3 id=\"what-is-a-freelancer-or-independent-contractor\">What is a freelancer or independent contractor?</h3><p>In 2020, 41% of American workforce was freelancing and the appeal of self employment continues to grow in 2021 with benefits like flexible schedules, work-from-anywhere opportunities, earning extra money, and project selection. As more businesses turn to remote or hybrid work environments in post-COVID world, it’s fair to say that freelancing isn’t going anywhere. In 2020, self employed workers contributed $1.2 trillion to the US economy making up 5.7% of the US GDP.</p><p>Somewhat interchangeable, the terms freelancer and independent contractor typically refer to a third-party person hired by a business to complete a series of tasks or a longer project that is adjacent to the principal business of the company. Freelancers represent an independent, small business, usually consisting of just one person who is working as a sole proprietor and has no employees. Similarly, an independent contractor can be a sole proprietor hired to work on a project though the duration of that project tends to be longer than that of freelance work.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-a-w-2-contractor\">What is a W-2 contractor?</h3><p>In some scenarios, an independent contractor could also refer to employees who are hired by a business for a specific task during a predetermined window of time. Some temp workers ultimately gain full time employment status with a business, but it is not the expectation for either the worker or business. Sometimes the “temp” worker or consultant files a W2 with their primary business, but is considered a contractor to the client that hires the agency. In other instances, temp workers are temporarily hired by the business who will deduct taxes and be treated closer to a regular employee. The determination for how payment is rendered to the temp worker is agreed upon upfront.</p><h3 id=\"how-are-employees-different\">How are employees different?</h3><p>What it really comes down to is the overall involvement of a business in the work of the person hired for how employee status is determined. While employees of a company are subject to defined work hours and company regulations with access to benefits, freelancers work independently with little oversight, can set their desired hours, and can complete the work in the manner of their choosing. Further, freelancers are responsible for filing their own taxes and independently creating retirement plans and healthcare options. </p><h2 id=\"how-to-pay-freelancers-and-independent-contractors\">How to pay freelancers and independent contractors</h2><p>Freelancers have desired compensation in mind when they submit a bid for work based on a few different factors like experience, market trends, workload, and timeline. Here are some things to keep in mind when reviewing a freelancer’s bid. Determine which of these options best fit the business need upfront before any work begins.</p><h3 id=\"reach-an-agreement-on-pay-rates\">Reach an agreement on pay rates</h3><p>The first element in paying independent contractors is to determine a rate for payment by looking at the workload that needs to be completed and in what time frame. A less experienced freelancer will charge a lower rate, but overall quality may differ from that of a more experienced person. A middle-of-the-road rate for a project could be impacted by a tighter deadline. Other factors that a freelancer may point to for a rate include: industry accepted guild rates, complexity of a project, and longevity of contract.</p><h3 id=\"hourly-vs-project-based\">Hourly vs. project-based</h3><p>Hourly rates are determined by the amount of time it takes to complete a project. Hourly rates are best applied to projects that have specific windows of work or when the hiring business has more visibility of the timeline. For example, temp workers hired to check-in attendees to a fundraising event will be paid hourly due to the definite time frame of the event.</p><p>Project-based rates are the total projected cost of a project, beginning to end. This rate is best used for open-ended projects where the amount of time spent to complete the project is subjective. For example, hiring a marketing consultant to create a branding package for a new product line. The amount of time it takes that marketing consultant to complete the project will be based on their familiarity of the industry and experience level.

For this reason, both the freelancer and hiring entity should\ncreate a structured timeline for payment.\n\nTime-based vs. milestone-based\nFor contracts that include smaller, redundant tasks or projects that have\ndefinitive timelines, time-based payments are a good solution. For example an\nartist hired to paint a mural in a new office space can ask to have a percentage\nof the total project cost to begin the work, with the remainder due at the\ncompletion.

They are estimated quarterly\nand reconciled at the end of the year when 1099-NEC forms are filed with the\nIRS.\n\nSending a 1099-MISC (1099-NEC) by January 31\nIf your business has worked with contractors throughout the year, you are\nlegally required to provide tax documentation to the contractor no later than\nJanuary 31st and to the IRS no later than February 28th. As of the 2020 tax\nseason, this form was updated from the 1099-Misc to the 1099-NEC for payments\nmade to self-employed individuals. A freelancer collects each of these documents\nfrom their clients and uses them to file taxes. Unlike employees who have taxes\nwithheld each pay period, self-employed individuals must determine what they owe\nand make those payments, usually quarterly, directly to the IRS. Failure to send\na 1099-NEC to a contractor or to the IRS will result in fines.\n\nBackup withholding when there's no SSN or TIN\nTo ensure that self-employed individuals are accurately reporting earnings, the\nIRS may send a business who is making payments to non-employee a “B” notice.\nThis is an indication that the tax identification number (TIN) or social\nsecurity number (SSN) for the non-employee is missing. If this happens, the\nbusiness should first send a notice to the individual to provide an updated W-9\nform. If the number continues to be unverified by the IRS, the business is\nrequired to withhold 24% of payments made to the self-employed individual. This\namount is recorded on the 1099-NEC form.\n\nPayment methods\nThere are many ways to pay your freelancer for their work. Each method has its\nown benefits and drawbacks.\n\nChecks\nChecks are still an important payment method. Checks offer oversight and control\nfor payment processing and can be used for large amounts that other payment\noptions cannot accommodate. Accepting check payments doesn’t require a bank\naccount and is specific to the payee helping to minimize fraud. However, checks\ntake much longer to receive and process than other methods, sometimes 7-10\nbusiness days from the time it is mailed to the time it is processed.\n\nACH transfers\nTo say that ACH payments are increasingly popular is putting it lightly. 1Q of\n2021 shows a growth of ACH market value by more than 130% over Q1 of 2020. ACH\nis a fast, secure option for just about any B2B payment that supports direct\ndeposit. Payments made using the Automated Clearing House batch at different\nintervals throughout the day, and are deposited directly into a payee’s account\nwithin a matter of days if not same-day.\n\nCredit cards\nPayments made with credit cards can be helpful when cash flow isn’t available\nwhen payment is due. Not every freelancer will be able to accept credit card\npayments, but online payment platforms help ease that burden. Credit card\npayments are subject to transaction fees which can result in a markup on project\ncost.\n\nWire transfers\nWith similar speed and security of ACH payments, wire transfers continue to be a\nbeneficial payment method, especially for international B2B contracts. Further,\nwire transfers can be made with cash through services like Western Union.\nProcessing fees are a drawback for wire transfers as they tend to occur both\nwhen initiated as well as by the receiving bank impacting the actual deposited\namount.\n\nOnline payment systems\nE-commerce payment processing platforms like Apple Pay and Google Pay are user\nfriendly and fast. Most importantly, they provide encryption that protects\nsensitive financial information unlike other payment processing options that\nrequire verification of account and routing numbers, in addition to personal\nidentification numbers before payment can be initiated.\n\nAccounting software\nUsing accounting software to process payments is beneficial because it\ncentralizes financial information: tracking AP and AR all in one place rather\nthan over multiple platforms that potentially requires manual input to bring the\ninformation together for reconciliation. However, payment types available within\naccounting software may be limited to printed checks and wire transfers. \n\nFreelancers are a vibrant group, a growing workforce, and could be the best\nsolution for offsetting employee workload to complete projects. Whether you’re\nlooking to staff an event, migrate to new software, improve social media\nengagements, or spruce up a new space with the help of a local artist, working\nwith independent contractors can enrich your workforce without the costs and\nrisks of hiring additional staff.\n\nSpeed up business payments with Routable\nIf your head is spinning a bit, we get it. That’s why Routable works directly\nwith SMB to enterprise businesses to make B2B payments simple, secure, and\nreliable. Users enjoy the high-touch adoption customer support that Routable\nteams offer and contractors benefit from fast onboarding and faster payments.

Once a requisition or request for spending has been approved, a\n    purchase order is created by a procurement department with detailed order\n    information including a specific PO Number that follows the order throughout\n    the full purchase-to-payment cycle.\n 2. Approval flow. Approvals will vary but may include management approval,\n    finance team approval, and executive level approvals. Confirmation may be\n    subject to maximum spending limits or available vendor pool.\n 3. PO dispatch. Once the PO has been approved internally, it is sent to the\n    selected vendor who also goes through an additional approval process subject\n    to accuracy of request details and available inventory.\n 4. Binding contract. Once approved by the vendor, the PO becomes a binding\n    contract between buyer and supplier. The supplier agrees to fill the order\n    per specifications on the PO and the buyer agrees to pay for the goods or\n    services.\n 5. Goods delivery. Once ready, the vendor delivers goods or completes services\n    provided.\n 6. 3-way matching. The receiving and accounting teams then begin a three-way\n    matching process to ensure order quantities, prices, and total costs are\n    consistent. Most deliverables include a receipt or packing slip that is\n    compared to the purchase order and invoice. Learn more about 3-way matching\n    accounting here! [__GHOST_URL__/3-way-matching/]\n 7. PO closure. Once all three documents—purchase order, packing slip, and\n    invoice—are found to match, the order is closed and payment can be\n    processed.\n\nConclusion\nWith the right business case, any purchase becomes viable, even cupcakes! While\nit may not always be the best solution or the fill the biggest need for spend\nallocation at a given time, by including layers of spend tracking like purchase\nrequisitions and purchase orders businesses ensure that they are making the best\nchoices at the right times.",

            "html": "<p>The terminology used in accounting to describe transactions and assets can be confusing. It doesn't help that bookkeepers sometimes use shorthand for these general ledger terms. Luckily, we can help you start to clear up some of the basics.</p><p>You will often see two consistent things on your company's balance sheet and income statement lines: a credit entry (often on the right side) and a debit entry (often on the left side). This method is known as double-entry bookkeeping and is the most common accounting recording system.</p><p>In both accounts payable (AP) and accounts receivable (AR), you will see credits and debits used when the value in your account increases or decreases. These terms help describe the inflow and outflow of cash from your different accounts, including asset accounts, expense accounts, and cash accounts. On the most basic level, debits indicate inflow, credits indicate outflow throughout all of your different accounts.</p><h2 id=\"is-accounts-payable-a-credit-or-debit\">Is accounts payable a credit or debit?</h2><p>Accounts payable, first and foremost, are liability accounts. These accounts are labeled this way because you often pay on credit when purchasing items or services from vendors and suppliers. Because you may owe money to these creditors, your AP account will have a credit balance showing any current liabilities. Later, when you pay back your invoice, accounting debits your credit balance that amount. With this knowledge, we can answer our question: accountants credit and also debit your accounts payable. Both inflow and outflow occur within accounts payable, so it is both a credited and debited account.</p><h2 id=\"recording-credits-and-debits-as-journal-entries\">Recording credits and debits as journal entries</h2><p>While most accounting software can help you track credits and debits as journal entries by default, some small businesses and individuals may track this manually. Many companies use software (especially automation software) to help cut down on the amount of time doing data entry. While programs are here to help, it is essential to know how this process works to know which software is best for your team.</p><p>When looking at basic examples of accounts payable, you will often be referencing a purchase or vendor invoice. After the seller communicates this to you and the invoice is accepted, you will debit your purchases or inventory account with the value of the items, then credit your AP account with that same amount.

            "plaintext": "The terminology used in accounting to describe transactions and assets can be\nconfusing. It doesn't help that bookkeepers sometimes use shorthand for these\ngeneral ledger terms. Luckily, we can help you start to clear up some of the\nbasics.\n\nYou will often see two consistent things on your company's balance sheet and\nincome statement lines: a credit entry (often on the right side) and a debit\nentry (often on the left side). This method is known as double-entry bookkeeping\nand is the most common accounting recording system.\n\nIn both accounts payable (AP) and accounts receivable (AR), you will see credits\nand debits used when the value in your account increases or decreases. These\nterms help describe the inflow and outflow of cash from your different accounts,\nincluding asset accounts, expense accounts, and cash accounts. On the most basic\nlevel, debits indicate inflow, credits indicate outflow throughout all of your\ndifferent accounts.\n\nIs accounts payable a credit or debit?\nAccounts payable, first and foremost, are liability accounts. These accounts are\nlabeled this way because you often pay on credit when purchasing items or\nservices from vendors and suppliers. Because you may owe money to these\ncreditors, your AP account will have a credit balance showing any current\nliabilities. Later, when you pay back your invoice, accounting debits your\ncredit balance that amount. With this knowledge, we can answer our question:\naccountants credit and also debit your accounts payable. Both inflow and outflow\noccur within accounts payable, so it is both a credited and debited account.\n\nRecording credits and debits as journal entries\nWhile most accounting software can help you track credits and debits as journal\nentries by default, some small businesses and individuals may track this\nmanually. Many companies use software (especially automation software) to help\ncut down on the amount of time doing data entry. While programs are here to\nhelp, it is essential to know how this process works to know which software is\nbest for your team.\n\nWhen looking at basic examples of accounts payable, you will often be\nreferencing a purchase or vendor invoice. After the seller communicates this to\nyou and the invoice is accepted, you will debit your purchases or inventory\naccount with the value of the items, then credit your AP account with that same\namount. When this is a short-term debt, you will later debit balance your AP\naccount when you pay back the obligation.\n\nThis process can still be a bit tricky when it hasn't been put into practice.\nLet's look at some examples of how this will look in your accounts payable\nentries.\n\nAccounts payable credit or debit examples\nCredit example\nFor our first example, we will follow the details we just used in the previous\nsection. Let's say your company purchases goods, such as $200 worth of office\nsupplies. This office supply expense will be a short-term liability, and you\nplan to pay the seller the total amount within the month. First, you will debit\nyour appropriate account, such as a purchases account. Then, you will credit\nyour AP account. Here is an example of this for a double-entry accounting\nsystem:\n\nDate\n\nAccount\n\nDebit\n\nCredit\n\n5/26/2021\n\nPurchases Account\n\n$200\n\n\n\nAccounts Payable Account\n\n\n$200\n\nDebit example\nOnce you are ready to pay back lenders, you will have to debit your accounts\npayable account and credit something, usually a cash account. So, what would\nthat look like in our ledger? Let's say we are paying back that $200 invoice on\nour office supplies:\n\nDate\n\nAccount\n\nDebit\n\nCredit\n\n6/2/2021\n\nAccounts Payable Account\n\n$200\n\n\n\nCash Account\n\n\n$200\n\nAccounts payable FAQs\nWhat type of account is accounts payable?\nYour accounts payable is a liability account, as is easily remembered by its\ncurrent liabilities section. Liability accounts show how much a company owes and\ninclude short-term liabilities like accounts payable and long-term liabilities\nlike loans payable. These accounts are essential in many ways, including\ncalculating your owner's equity accounts and accurate tracking of your company's\nfinancial health.\n\nWhat is the journal entry for accounts payable?\nAny time you have an expense (for example, a rent expense, a vendor purchase, or\nan advertising expense), you will most likely credit your accounts payable\naccount and debit another account. The basic journal entry for this will be:\n\nDate\n\nAccount\n\nDebit\n\nCredit\n\nXX/XX/XX\n\nAccounts Payable Account\n\n$X\n\n\n\nX Account\n\n\n$X\n\nYou will then later pay this amount off to the creditor/vendor. When this\nhappens, you will debit your accounts payable account and credit the appropriate\naccount to represent paying that owed amount off.\n\nWhat about accounts receivable?\nRather than being a liability account, accounts receivable is a current asset\naccount. Accounts receivable works in much the opposite way of accounts payable,\nwhere you will often be debiting the accounts receivable account and crediting\nanother. Once the customer pays off the invoice, you will credit your accounts\nreceivable account to represent that paid invoice.\n\nAutomate accounts payable with Routable\nEarlier, we mentioned that automation software can help make tracking accounts\npayable much easier. By reducing time spent on manual data entry, software\nupdates, and vendor management, these products can help you cut costs and\nempower your accounting team to scale with your company. This tech can also\nprevent your company from costly mistakes and help better track data for\naccurate audit reporting.\n\nA great example of accounting automation software is Routable\n[https://routable.com/payables]. With Routable, customers saw 40% saved on the\ncost of bill payments and mass payouts and a 70% reduction in repetitive tasks\nthat bog down automation teams.

            "plaintext": "Making the best choices for your business will always be dependent on being\ninformed of the options available. Wire transfers have been instrumental in\nmoving funds from one business to another since we used telegraphs to\ncommunicate. Direct deposits have vastly improved how employees are compensated,\nredefining payday as the day your money hits your bank account rather than just\ncollecting a paper check. As money transfer technology evolves, knowing when—and\nwhere—to use each option is essential to bringing the best experience to payees\nwhile making the most efficient and cost-saving choice for your business.\n\nWhat is a wire transfer?\nWire transfers electronically move money from one bank account to another. The\ntransfers can occur domestically and internationally; from banks within the same\nchain or between two different banks connected by a network of financial\ninstitutions. For international payments, wire transfers account for currency\nexchange and allow for larger payments, though maximum limits may differ from\nbank to bank.\n\nTo complete a wire transfer, the payer provides either their banking information\nor cash as well as the payee’s name and full address, bank account number, bank\nrouting number (also known as the American Bankers Association (ABA) number, and\nauthorization. Additionally, the wire transfer may require the payee’s bank\nnumber and address. For international wire transfers, a Bank Identification Code\n(BIC)/Swift code and an International Bank Account Number (IBAN).\n\nWhile the actual transfer of funds is completed electronically, wire transfers\nare usually initiated in person either at a bank or through an institution like\nWestern Union. Due to security issues, banks prefer in-person verification for\nthis type of payment method.\n\nHow long does a wire transfer take?\nWire transfers generally complete within 24 hours from the time they are\ninitiated with the transferred money available to the payee in local currency.\nHowever, bank locations and time of initiating transfer may have an impact on\nthat. International wire transfers may take up to 3-4 business days.\n\nWhat is direct deposit?\nDirect deposits are an electronic fund transfer (EFT) that occurs from one bank\naccount to another. Direct deposits use an automated clearing house (ACH) to\ncomplete the transaction. These transactions are overseen by the National\nAutomated Clearing House Association (NACHA). Direct deposits are for domestic\ntransfers only though some international direct deposits that are available for\nselect use cases like military payments. Any available options for international\ndirect deposits are regulated by the International Treasury Service (ITC) and\nuse SWIFT and fedwire protocols to complete.\n\nDirect deposits are used for recurring transfers or large batch transfers like\npaychecks, tax returns, and government benefits. To initiate a direct deposit, a\nrecipient provides a bank account number, routing number, and authorization to\nthe sender.\n\nDirect deposits are not the same as payments made using services like Paypal or\nVenmo. While these options do provide an immediate transfer of funds, the money\ndoes not go directly into a bank account; an additional step is included in the\nprocess for recipient settlement.\n\nHow long does a direct deposit take?\nMost direct deposit payments take 3-5 business days to process once they are\ninitiated. However, according to NACHA, business owners can opt-in to “same day”\ndirect deposits that initiate 1-2 days in advance for payroll.\n\nWhat are the advantages of wire transfers and direct deposits?\nAdvantages of wire transfers\n * Fast. Wire transfers happen quicker than other payment methods like mailing\n   paper checks.\n * International. Wire transfers can be used to make international payments with\n   the recipient’s funds available in local currency.\n * Accessible. Wire transfers do not require a bank account and they can be\n   initiated with cash, making them a preferred payment method for many migrant\n   or overseas workers looking to send money to family in the country of origin.\n\nAdvantages of direct deposits\n * Risk management. Direct deposits reduce the kind of fraud risks that come\n   with traditional payment methods. Companies that use direct deposit enjoy the\n   control while employees benefit from paychecks arriving on-time and ready for\n   use.\n * Cost saving. Direct deposits have lower transaction fees than other\n   electronic payment methods. They also save users on bookkeeping supplies like\n   ink and check paper.\n * Ease.

Larger companies that make\n   payments in various locations are able to make faster payments rather than\n   rely on snail mail.\n\nWire transfer vs. direct deposit: A detailed comparison\nSafety and security\nSending money electronically through wire transfers and direct deposits offers a\nhigher level of security than sending paper checks which can be lost and are\nsusceptible to fraud.

            "plaintext": "If your company bills on credit, accounts receivable are an integral part of\nyour accounting. From ensuring an expedient Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) to\npreventing late payments and disputes, having accurate accounting systems for AR\nis essential. Unfortunately, manual processes can complicate efficient accounts\nreceivable implementations due to complex workflows and the manual errors that\ncan plague the collections processes. AR teams can struggle without extra\nresources, and this added pressure can lead to accuracy problems and delay.\n\nLuckily, that is where accounts receivable software comes in with features such\nas enhanced visibility, automated real-time reminders, and credit management. AR\nsoftware has many positives that will help your accounts receivable system run\nsmoother for both you and your vendors. Before we hop into the benefits of\naccounts receivable automation, let's talk about how accounts receivable affects\nyour accounting and cash process from invoicing to cash application.\n\nWhat are accounts receivable?\nAccounts receivable is money that is owed to your business by your suppliers for\ngoods and services. In the accounts receivable workflow, you send the customer\ntheir bill through either mailing invoices physically or through email. The\nclient will then pay it by the payment terms you established for the purchases.\nERP systems or AR automation solutions often have portals or alternative, more\naccessible methods for customers to pay e-invoices.\n\nThere are different types of accounts receivable that get broken down by various\nmetrics. These subcategories include trade receivables, notes receivables,\nvendor receivables, interest receivables, and employee receivables. What\ncategories you use under the accounts receivable umbrella will depend on your\ncompany's architecture. You can learn more about accounts receivable and its\nsub-types here [__GHOST_URL__/what-is-accounts-receivable/].\n\nWhy you should automate accounts receivable\nAR automation software helps your team in a handful of ways. From faster invoice\napproval to interactive dashboards that give accurate and helpful analytics,\nthese programs can help save you time and money.\n\nPredictable cash flow\nIn a traditional accounting system, your invoices and reminders have to be sent\nmanually to customers. These messages are automated through automated accounts\nreceivable, meaning customers are always reminded on time. This function also\nmeans your team can spend more time monitoring your cash flow rather than just\nbadgering your customers.\n\nAR automation software also often includes a more accessible platform for\npayments, whether they are via credit card or ACH payment. Through this\nsimplification of the payment process and timely reminders, you not only create\na more predictable cash flow process but also improve your working capital and\nsave time for your AR manager and team.\n\nImproved AR metrics\nWith immediately processed invoices and payments, automatic reminders, and\ndashboards that improve late payment visibility, you can easily enhance your AR\nmetrics through automation. AR automation Empowers your team with the tools to\nsee those customers that are close to the deadline and also frees up their time\nto pursue these problems before they snowball.\n\nSave time and labor hours\nManually entering every single invoice can bog down your accounting team\nimmensely. By cutting out even just manual entry alone, you can empower your\nteam to spend time focusing on what matters most. Most accounting automation\nsoftware also automates reminder messages, analytics, and payment processes,\nsaving even more time for your team. This time saving means a more effective and\nproductive team that doesn't have to worry about overtime when the end of an\naccounting period is looming.\n\nLess bad debt\nWhen you collect your debts slowly, it can eventually snowball into your company\nhaving to take on loans and bad debt. As is seen in both small and large\ncompanies alike, this can turn into a quick downward financial spiral.\nAutomation can help your team stay on top of collections, keeping your company's\ncash flow consistent.\n\nAccounts receivables workflows are ripe for automation\nWe keep talking about how automation will open up your accounting team's time\ndue to eliminating and simplifying processes.

            "plaintext": "You’ve decided to begin a new revenue stream for your mid-sized employee\nengagement company. Where before you would facilitate similar programming across\nyour book of business, you now want to offer premium services to enterprise\nlevel clients. To sign on to the premium experience, clients may opt-in by\npaying $5,000 for events, perks, and quality assurance that will occur over the\nnext 6 months. The influx of cash flow as clients opt-in is an exciting moment,\nespecially for small businesses, but it’s important to take responsibility for\nhow this transaction is recorded, applied, and what they represent.\n\nWhat is unearned revenue?\nThe $5,000 payment you’ve received from your clients for the premium experience\nis considered unearned revenue. While you have been able to bring your clients\nin on a new premium experience, your business has yet to provide the services or\nproducts that have been promised in return for the opt-in. For this reason, the\nrevenue is considered “unearned” and is recorded as a liability in the books.\n\nExamples of Unearned Revenue\nUnearned revenue can be an exciting and effective way to fund growth strategies\nwhile simultaneously testing the validity of those strategies. Customers that\nsee the value in the advanced payment will pay. Let’s take a look at examples of\n“pre-payment.”\n\nExample 1: Subscriptions and Prepaid Cards\nIf your business makes annual subscription payments for SaaS providers, has\nnewspaper magazine subscriptions, or offers mass transit passes as an employee\nbenefit, you are making advance payments. The seller that receives these\npayments is agreeing to provide, over time, a service that you’ve already paid\nfor. They would record the full amount as a credit to unearned revenue and then\ncredit the cash account each month incrementally. Making these payments\nguarantees the newspaper subscriber or bus rider access to these services while\nthe funds provide the service provider and transit operator the means to\nmaintain, grow, and develop those services.\n\nExample 2: Cash Flow and Production Burden\nUnearned revenue can also occur on a much larger scale than say a monthly bus\npass. The $5,000 advance payments you’ve asked for from enterprise clients will\nresult in premium services down the road. Those funds give your business the\ncash flow to hire and train new staff, design and launch a 24hr customer service\napp, and secure custom products from your supplier: each of these criteria is\npart of providing the premium service. It may even be that the advance payment\nyour business receives is in turn paid to a vendor who requires a down payment\nfor the increased production of components you already use. Your unearned\nrevenue fuels growth across an array of other businesses. Without the prepaid\nfunds, the new services would not be possible.\n\nHow to record unearned revenue\nRecording unearned revenue can be a little tricky. In accrual accounting, the\nrevenue is recorded as a liability and then credited or debited between accounts\nas necessary over time. Let’s take a look at the lifecycle of one $5,000\nadvanced payment.\n\nDetermine $5,000 as a liability\nUnearned revenue is classified as a current liability on the balance sheet. It\nis a liability because it reflects money that has been received while services\nto earn that money have yet to be provided. If for some reason the company was\nnot able to provide those services, the money may be forfeit.\n\nJournal entries\nThe $5,000 has two entries: The first is a record of $5,000 debit to a cash\naccount. The second is a $5,000 credit to unearned revenue. One way to remember\nhow this works is to think of the income account as a lender to the unearned\nrevenue account. The unearned revenue must eventually pay back the cash account\nas services are rendered.\n\nEstimate amounts needed to perform specific service tasks\nWith prepayments in hand, your business can now budget where that money will go\nand for what reasons. After careful assessment you know that for each\nprepayment: $2,000 will go into hiring and training new staff, $2,000 to program\na 24hr customer service app, and $1,000 is prepaid to your supplier to\nanticipate larger orders as the premium service launches.\n\nDebit to unearned revenue, credits to cash\nAs each of the premium service elements are implemented, additional entries are\nmade by the bookkeeper to indicate that services have been provided to the\nclient. For example, once the new staff is hired and trained, a $2,000 debit\nentry to unearned revenue is entered and a $2,000 credit entry to cash is\nentered.\n\nAdd earned revenue to income\nAs the unearned revenue account is debited and the cash account is credited, the\namounts change classification on the balance sheet. Where once the $5,000 was a\nliability, it is now a cash asset on the income statement.\n\nAdhere to government reporting procedures\nTo comply with GAAP procedures—especially as a publicly traded company—revenue\nis recorded when work is actually performed. Another way of stating this is that\nboth the income from a project and the expenses for the project must be recorded\nin the same time period according to regulations by the Security and Exchange\nCommission (SEC).\n\nUnearned revenue FAQs\nIs unearned revenue a contra account?\nUnearned revenue is not a contra account.

            "plaintext": "Whenever your company receives an invoice for a transaction with suppliers, it\ngets tracked within your accounts payables. The accounts payable category helps\nyou track any short-term debts or obligations to creditors, such as on purchases\nof goods and services. Since so many companies make these purchases, keeping\ntrack of AP inflow and outflow is crucial to understanding your cash flow.\nBecause of this importance, having a specialized AP department that can monitor\nthe payables process and prevent things such as payments on inaccurate invoices\nis essential. Having an accurate accounts payable balance can dramatically\naffect your cash flow statement and accounts payable turnover ratio, leading to\nbetter data for analytics and reporting.\n\nWhat is accounts payable (AP)?\nAccounts payable, simply put, is a type of debt. It tracks the money you owe\nvendors for goods and services. This large umbrella can encompass a large swath\nof transactions, such as travel expenses, purchases of raw materials, and\ntypical vendor payments. AP shows as an account within your general ledger when\na company follows the accrual accounting method. When you track these short-term\nliabilities, they are found appropriately within the current liabilities section\nof your company's balance sheet. Because of this, accounts payable are\nconsidered a current liability account, while accounts receivable are classified\nas a current asset account (or simply an asset account).\n\nWhile accounts payable is often considered the same thing as trade payables, it\nis important to realize they refer to slightly different things. Trade payables\nshow the money that is owed to creditors for inventory-related items. For\nexample, when your company purchases goods like office supplies, this falls\nunder the trade payables umbrella.\n\nIs accounts payable a debit or credit?\nWhen you owe debts to your vendors, your accounts payable entries will have a\ncredit balance that shows any current liabilities. Once you pay that invoice,\nyour credit balance will be debited that same amount. This fact means that it is\nboth a credited and debited account because accounts payable has inflow and\noutflow.\n\nIn double entry bookkeeping, the debit shows on the left side of your journal\nentry, and a credit on the following journal entry would be on the right side.\nFor example, here is a basic entry where someone has bought $400 of a product\nand then later pays that amount back from a cash account:\n\nDate\n\nAccount\n\nDebit\n\nCredit\n\n7/1/2021\n\nPurchases Account\n\n$400\n\n\n\nAccounts Payable Account\n\n\n$400\n\n7/15/2021\n\nAccounts Payable Account\n\n$400\n\n\n\nCash Account\n\n\n$400\n\nMany types of account software simplify double entry bookkeeping for you and\nyour team. Some software even helps automate manual parts of this process for\nyou. For more information about automation software and its benefits, take a\nlook at the end of our article!\n\nWhat are some examples of accounts payable?\nThere are many situations where accounts payable comes into play. Many of these\nexamples go through an entire purchase order (PO) workflow before being added as\na payable journal entry, but they all may have slightly differing processing.\nSome examples of different types of accounts payable include trade payables and\nwages payable. Here are some other accounts payable examples that you may\nencounter:\n\nRaw materials purchases\nRaw materials are the resources your company uses to make its products. For\nexample, lumber or steel are common examples. These purchases are considered\ninventory assets. Raw materials can be classified into two subcategories, direct\nmaterials, which are the raw materials used to make your products (lumber,\nnails). In contrast, indirect materials are used to produce these items but\naren't directly used within the product itself (such as factory machine parts).\n\nTransportation and logistics\nAny debts for transportation, logistics, or freights fall under accounts\npayable. Since these logistics costs often are a huge factor in a company's\nprofit margins, it is essential to keep careful track of these payments. It\nisn't uncommon for larger companies to outsource their transportation and\nlogistics through a third-party company, often referred to as 3PL.\n\nAssembling and subcontracting works\nWhen someone like a subcontractor sends you an invoice, it is considered\naccounts payable as you pay them back for their services. Subcontracting within\naccounts payable is particularly common within the construction industry but is\nbecoming more common as subcontractors grow in number. Keeping this process as\nsmooth as possible is vital to keep your subcontractors happy and paid on time.\n\nTravel expenses\nTravel expenses that employees accrue are sent to the accounting team and\nreimbursed through accounts payable. These charges can include things like Uber\nor taxi charges, flight tickets, and hotel room expenses. The items that can be\nexpensed in this way will depend on the company's policy but should be paid back\npromptly regardless so that the money isn't absent from the employee's pocket\nfor too long.\n\nEquipment\nMost of a company's equipment that is purchased will go through accounts payable\nat some point. This tracking includes rented equipment such as larger\nconstruction tools or vehicles and items bought for the office like machinery\nparts. Equipment can take on many different forms depending on the industry your\ncompany works in but regardless is often a pretty hefty expense.\n\nLeasing\nAny leases, whether on office space or for equipment, are counted within your\naccounts payable. These kinds of payments often also fall under the lease\naccounting category. There are two common types of leases, which are operating\nleases and financing leases. These lease types are differentiated by whether\nthere is lower risk and lower reward, or vice versa.\n\nLicensing\nThere are many times when licensing fees fall within accounts payable. For\ninstance, if your company often deals with licenses for software such as\nMicrosoft Office, patents, or copywritten items, you may have many licensing\ntransactions. The most common of these are software licenses, as many companies\nhave to pay for their users to have access to standard necessary tools for their\ndaily work. Software licenses can be a one-time charge, but more and more often\nare monthly or yearly charges.\n\nVendor payments\nWhen you receive a vendor invoice, the payable process comes into play. As long\nas you owe a debt to those vendors, the amount will stay credited to your AP\naccount. Once you pay them off, you will debit your AP account and credit\nanother account, such as a cash account. Vendor payments can cover a large\nportion of your transactions depending on your company structure, so keeping\nthese organized and well-managed can be essential.\n\nAutomate accounting with Routable\nThe best way to tackle your accounts payable or accounts receivable is by\nempowering your team with automation. These tools can help your team with things\nlike risk reduction and vendor relations. By implementing AP automation, you\nsave time for your payable department to focus on things that matter most such\nas vendor relationships.

            "plaintext": "Market outlooks project that by the end of 2021, digital payments will total\nover $6.6 trillion in transactions (report\n[https://financesonline.com/online-payments-statistics/]). Influenced by both a\nglobal pandemic that led buyers to hands-free, contact-free payment solutions as\nwell as digital-age users who overwhelmingly prefer to use their mobile devices\nfor banking, the necessity for online payments is paramount to successful\nbusiness operations today; a practice that will only continue to compound as\ntime goes on.\n\nWhat is online payment software?\nThe ease of making online purchases or payments has dramatically increased in\nthe last decade leaving users a little in the dark when it comes to\nunderstanding just how money moves from one entity to another. Online payment\nsoftware facilitates this process and gives the impression that it’s all\nhappening in one place when in fact there are a number of entities and steps\ninvolved.\n\nFirst, a bank (“issuer”) provides a credit or debit card to a cardholder. The\nissuer will approve or deny transactions, billing the cardholder as necessary.\nVisa, Mastercard, and AmericanExpress are examples of issuers. The cardholder\nuses the bank-issued card to initiate purchases with a business owner\n(“merchant”) who has a merchant account. Once a purchase has been initiated, the\nmerchant pushes the authorization information to a merchant service provider\n(MSP, or “acquirer”) to process the transaction. While the merchant account may\nsimply be the business’s bank, often there is a payment processor involved who\npartners with—and provides technology to—the acquirer for merchant use. The\npayment processor ensures that payments are cleared and funded into the merchant\nbank account. More often than not, a day’s worth of transactions are batched at\nonce rather than individually.\n\nIf your head is swimming, you’re not alone. Payment processing terms haven’t\nchanged much over time, but they have taken on more inclusive meanings as the\ndigital age transforms how various payments are completed.\n\nPayment processors and payment service providers\nA payment processor, or payment service provider (PSP), facilitates transactions\nfrom buyer to business, ensuring that the business receives the payments for\ntheir goods or services. They function as a mediator between two entities to\ncollect payment information, providing that information to both the issuing and\nreceiving bank, and communicating authorization or decline of payments.\n\nBusinesses of all sizes who accept, process, and/or store credit card or debit\ncard payments must remain compliant with Payment Card Industry Data Security\nStandards (PCI DSS, or just PCI). These standards were established in 2006 and\nare overseen by PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC). Payment service\nproviders should be providing information to their users on their PCI-compliant\nstandards.\n\nPayment system\nPayment service providers equip their users with systems to efficiently manage\npayments. These are called point of sale (POS) systems. If the payment service\nis your bank, they will provide hardware to run credit cards for in-person\ntransactions. For online payments, this is usually a third-party software that\nthe business pays to oversee payments digitally. Rather than hardware, different\ntypes of software are involved that support the options the payment provider\noffers.\n\nPSP online system complexity will vary. Some businesses will be able to use\nsoftware provided by their bank to integrate with their website. However,\ncompatibility between the two entities may be limited. In other cases,\nbusinesses use software that integrates with their website and that platform\noffers payment gateway and processing options. Merchants are able to merchandise\ntheir items online, and buyers are prompted to use that payment platform. These\nprocessors automatically factor shipping costs, tax, and transaction fees into\nthe final cost of goods.\n\nPayment gateway vs payment processor: What’s the difference?\nWhen a client decides they would like to purchase something from the business, a\nfinancial transaction is initiated. In a brick and mortar retail location, this\nmay look like a guest swiping a credit card on a physical machine that captures\nthe card data, requests any authorization in the form of a signature or PIN, and\nnotifies the issuing bank to transfer funds to the merchant account.\n\nIn an online landscape, instead of a physical card swipe, a payment gateway is\nused to capture and encrypt financial information to prevent fraud. The\nencrypted data is then provided to the payment processor who oversees the\ntransaction from initiating bank to receiving bank.\n\nWhile some payment service providers offer end-to-end options that include both\nthe payment gateway and the payment processor, the two elements should not be\nconsidered synonymous. Both are required for secure online payments from\nclients, and knowing whether the payment service provider is only one or the\nother will make a significant difference. Merchants that do not verify their\npayment processor includes a payment gateway may find that client financial data\nis at risk, making the merchant not PCI compliant.\n\nPaypal is an example of a payment service provider that is both the payment\ngateway and the payment processor. Paypal users can exchange funds within the\npaypal platform without the need for inputting sensitive banking information for\neach transaction. But the funds remain within Paypal’s platform. Once a user\ndecides to deposit their funds into their bank account, Paypal processes that\ntransaction.\n\nCommon features of payment processing software\nGreat online payment software should be impeccably user friendly for both\nmerchant and buyer. Common options available are:\n\nOnline payments\nPayment processing software helps to make B2B payments seamless, eliminating the\nslow snail-mail method. Businesses are able to create, send, and receive\ninvoices automatically. Businesses are then able to initiate and receive\npayments in real time with minimal time for processing and deposit.\n\nPOS transactions\nMuch the same way that a consumer can fill up a cart with items they wish to\npurchase as they shop, so can customers fill up a digital cart before they\nprocess their transactions. These mobile point of sale (mPOS) options allow\nbusinesses to integrate inventory data so that as online shoppers buy items, the\nmerchant tracks stock levels. Further, payment software will often include a\ndashboard to review time of day and product trends for future inventory\nplanning.\n\nRecurring billing\nSubscriptions, membership fees, phone and utility bills, rent—payment processing\nsoftware makes these bills simple to process and maintain. Buyers are prompted\nto provide payment information one time and authorize future payments for an\nagreed timeline in exchange for services or goods over that timeline. Payment\nsoftware providers offer customizable email payment reminders as well as flag\nerrors that may have occurred in the payment process.\n\nDigital payments\nJust as we have all watched cash payments move aside, familiar use of the\nphysical credit or debit card is beginning to wane. Advances in how payments are\nmade include use of finger-tip verification or face ID (biometrics), contactless\npayments in the form of chip technology so you can simply tap a card, using\nsmart speakers to be able to initiate payments, and even payments made on social\nmedia sites rather than redirecting to merchant website.\n\nAutomation\nAP and AR automation options make use of AI to read, record, and process B2B\nbilling, minimizing human error and gaps in data. Automation speeds up\nreconciliation so that business owners can make strategic choices faster and\nwith more confidence that the data is accurate.\n\nWhy are online payment services needed?\nMeet customer expectations.\nCustomer experience in the e-commerce environment will make or break retention\nand purchase recurrence. Modern consumers want fast, secure payment options.\nToday, even small businesses are able to offer both with the use of online\npayment services.\n\nSpeed up the payment process\nThe convenience of fast and secure payments goes both ways. Businesses also want\npayments to process quickly, improving cash flow. With online payment services,\ntransactions are initiated in real-time, removing the need for deposit trips to\nthe bank or waiting for checks in the mail.\n\nEasily manage vendors & customer data\nPayment platforms simplify managing customer and vendor data. Traditional retail\nsettings are not conducive to collecting customer contact information for future\npromotions—we’ve all stood in that line while a customer uncomfortably recites\ntheir email address. Online payment systems make this data collection a part of\nthe transaction so that even a one-time payment can turn into a retention\nclient.\n\nMake faster payments with Routable\nAutomated accounts receivable\nRoutable makes getting paid easy through automated invoicing, real time\naccounting software updates, and accepting various online payment options so you\ncan connect with a diverse landscape of clients and vendors.\n\nRobust API\nMaking sure your software options are communicating and functioning together is\nparamount in keeping business running smoothly.

Whether optimizing cash flow,\ncreating better stability, or cutting a profit, there are many reasons why the\nparties involved would be interested in entering into a reverse factoring deal.\nThere are a few main benefits to consider for both suppliers and buyers when\nlooking at the reverse factoring market.\n\nBenefits for suppliers\n * Access lower-cost funding: Because the financial institution uses the buyer's\n   credit score when making a deal, it can mean that the supplier benefits from\n   a lower interest rate. While this isn't always the case depending on the\n   situation, this often applies, especially when the buyer is a larger company.\n * Better working capital: Getting money faster means a better cash flow and\n   better working capital position. Every supplier wants their invoices to be\n   paid as soon as possible for this reason, and they can dramatically reduce\n   late or delayed payments through reverse factoring.\n * Investment and expansion: The faster a supplier receives their compensation,\n   the quicker they can invest it into their operations. By expanding the\n   workforce, research, and development, having money quicker means\n   fast-tracking a company's growth.\n * More accurate cash forecasting: If a supplier knows that a financial\n   institution will be paying their invoices consistently and quickly, it leads\n   to more reliability on that money when it comes to forecasting. This\n   reliability means that when making essential cash decisions, the supplier can\n   be more sure that they will have that money in the bank when they need it.\n * Reduced administrative work: Suppliers will no longer have to chase around\n   buyers for their payments or worry about ongoing invoice management when\n   working with a professional institute like a bank. The process is much\n   smoother and less time-consuming.\n\nBenefits for buyers\n * Better working capital: Just like for suppliers, reverse factoring brings\n   better cash flow and working capital for buyers. If a company struggles to\n   make payments after receiving something like raw materials, this can\n   dramatically improve its ability to make payments on a better timeline.\n * Flexibility: Some companies inherently have a less stable cash flow. Having\n   the flexibility that reverse factoring provides can be a huge buffer for\n   these companies.\n * Reduce the risk of supply chain issues: Suppliers have an easier time getting\n   materials to the buyer if they receive accelerated payments. To prevent\n   issues with the supply chain, reverse factoring can help get payments to the\n   supplier as quickly as possible.\n * Better relationships: Establishing a reverse factoring process with a\n   supplier can lead to a much better relationship. The most significant pain\n   point between buyers and sellers is often late payments. This bonus can later\n   pay off in the form of improved terms and negotiations with those partners.\n * Less liability: Since the financial institution takes on liability risk, the\n   buyer has less to worry about. By lessening your liability, it not only is\n   generally beneficial but helps improve your company balance sheet as well.\n * Reduced administrative work: Like for suppliers, involving a funder for your\n   financing means that you have less paperwork and communication with your\n   supplier. You won't get nagging requests regarding early payments and will\n   have less paperwork overall.\n\nPros and cons for financial institutions\nOne of the most considerable benefits for financiers is the long-term income\nthey gain through the supplier's interest payments. Reverse factoring can\nprovide significant income growth for these institutions as long as the parties\ninvolved stick to their promises. However, issues can quickly arise if the\ncompanies involved are a credit risk or don't pay back the financial\ninstitutions in a timely manner, leading to headaches for the financier. Because\nof this, financial institutions should be mindful of who they enter into reverse\nfactoring deals with but should certainly consider this as a potential revenue\nsource.\n\nThe difference between traditional factoring and reverse factoring\nThe most upfront difference between reverse factoring and traditional factoring\n(also known as invoice factoring) is that it works in the opposite direction. In\nthese situations, the factoring is initiated on the supplier's end rather than\nby the buyer. In comparison with traditional factoring, reverse factoring is\nmuch quicker but provides a little less payment to the supplier. This increase\nin speed is often worth the small fees for the supplier, and it provides many\nstability benefits. Additionally, it is not categorized as debtor finance\nbecause of the nature of reverse factoring while standard factoring is.\n\nWho uses reverse factoring?\nReverse factoring is most commonly seen with large companies that have the\nsubstantial credit to bring on financial institutions as partners in a reverse\nfactoring deal. Small companies that have clients that are large businesses can\nbenefit extremely from reverse factoring, saving money, and creating a more\nstable relationship for the long term. Financial institutions have a lot of\nbenefits to gain from reverse factoring, but also a lot of risks. This risk\nmeans that not all financial institutions should take the leap into reverse\nfactoring as a main revenue source, especially if they don't already have\nrelationships with large, reliable companies.\n\nConclusion\nReverse factoring can be an excellent solution for suppliers who need\naccelerated payments, buyers who are looking for longer-term financing\nsolutions, or financial institutions looking for extra revenue. At the same\ntime, while there are many benefits to reverse factoring, consider if it is\ntruly right for your situation before jumping in, especially as a financier.\nTraditional factoring may be a better option for your particular situation.",

For\nlarger purchases, purchase requisition paperwork is completed and provided to\nsupervisors for approval before reimbursement.\n\nAdditional controls of cash disbursements include: three-way document matching\nfor vendor payments, vendor validation and account accuracy review, having new\nemployees sign expense agreements—clearly stated guidelines—during the\non-boarding process.\n\nBank deposits, bank reconciliations, and safeguarding cash\nEmployees who have ever worked from a cash drawer at a retail location will be\nfamiliar with the process of counting in and out a drawer at the beginning and\nend of shift. This is a process that establishes a baseline value that the\ndrawer should have and what it must be returned to at the end of a shift; the\nsum difference when one employee counts out the drawer should equal the\nelectronic record of sales from the day in addition to credit card receipts.\n\nThese cash amounts are then compiled by a supervisor and secured in a safe or\nlockbox until a deposit is made. Making regular deposits ensures there is never\na large amount of cash on hand. It is also important to reconcile the bank\nstatement with the amounts in the general ledger. To help maintain separation of\nduties, the person reconciling the bank account and making journal entries would\nbe different from both the cashier and the supervisor. Further, access to the\nsecured elements in the process would be limited, and the business would\ntypically have employee bonding insurance.\n\nCOSO frameworks for cash controlling best practices\nWhat is COSO?\nBusiness fraud is no joke and took center stage in the late 90s when major\ncorporations were found to be operating fraudulently, causing billions in\nlosses. In 2002, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) was passed requiring publicly\ntraded companies to undergo an annual audit to remain in compliance with\nfinancial records.\n\nTo help businesses counteract fraud and establish best practice frameworks for\nprevention, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) was established.\nThe commission is made up of the American Accounting Association (AAA), the\nAmerican Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), Financial Executives\nInternational (FEI), The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), and the National\nAssociation of Accountants (now the Institute of Management Accountants [IMA]).\n\nWhat are the COSO frameworks for internal control and ERM?\nCOSO provides a framework that businesses can follow to establish, evaluate, and\nimprove internal controls and enterprise risk management (ERM). This framework\nwas developed in addition to a series of published reports for internal\ncontrol—originally published in 1992  with updates in 2013 and 2020—and\nERM—originally published in 2004 and updated in 2017. COSO also provides\nnumerous thought leadership articles to further breadth of understanding on\ntopics such as: board of directors roles, improving performance, and gaining\nstrategic advantage through ERM. Discover these COSO reports and articles here\n[https://www.coso.org/Pages/guidance.aspx].\n\nVisually, the COSO framework is a model presented as a colorful, segmented cube\nthat overlays objectives, components, and organizational structures. For all 3\ninternal control objectives there are 5 applicable components that can be\nimplemented throughout 4 organizational structures.\n\nWhat are the 3 internal control COSO objectives?\n 1. Operations. This objective looks at the way that the internal controls are\n    implemented within a company. Are the controls being utilized by employees?\n    Are they effective and realistic? \n 2. Reporting. This objective looks at the reports that are being provided by a\n    company. Are they consistent, reliable, and accurate?\n 3. Compliance. This objective looks at legality of a business operation. Are\n    state and local regulations being adhered to?\n\nWhat are the 5 internal control COSO components?\nThough summarized here, each of the 5 components listed can be further broken\ndown into a total of 17 principles\n[https://www.coso.org/Documents/COSO-ICIF-11x17-Cube-Graphic.pdf].\n\n 1. Control environment. The board of directors define the approach to internal\n    controls as well as the ethical values and goals of the company. These are\n    then translated by management through processes and policies to employees.\n    Companies also actively work to employ individuals who will implement,\n    uphold, and be accountable, helping the company maintain their ethics and\n    promote their goals.\n 2. Risk assessment. Risk likelihood to company objectives are identified\n    including both internal and external possibilities. Management considers how\n    the implementation of any change to internal or external operations may\n    negatively impact the company specifically as it relates to internal\n    control.\n 3. Control activities. All levels within a company include control activities,\n    either to prevent and correct any risks in the internal controls, through\n    processes both manual and automatic. Segregations of duties in internal\n    controls is one of the best ways to establish risk prevention at all levels.\n 4. Information & communication. Communication and transparency are bedrock to\n    maintaining internal control. Management utilizes reliable and accurate\n    information as it relates to control processes and procedures. This\n    information is communicated internally and externally as necessary to\n    acknowledge risk assessment and mitigation.\n 5. Monitoring activities. The company willfully engages in internal and\n    external monitoring at regular or predictable frequency to determine if\n    risks in the control environment are effectively being prevented or\n    corrected. Audits and independent CPA reconciliations are examples of\n    monitoring activities.\n\nWhat are the 4 COSO internal control organizational structures?\nCompany structure is demonstrated on the COSO cube framework to illustrate that\ninternal controls should exist at all levels for fraud prevention. Controls at\nbase levels are more detailed while controls at a higher level have a more\nbroad, overall impact to a business.\n\n 1. Entity level. Executive level of the business including the board of\n    directors. An example of entity-level control would be a company code of\n    conduct which impacts all levels of structure.\n 2. Division. Divisions in a company can also be described as different\n    departments: accounting, operations, sales, etc. Division level controls are\n    specific to each department. For example, a procurement request form\n    submitted by a member of the sales team wouldn’t be sent to the warehouse\n    manager for approval.\n 3. Operating Unit. An operating unit further breaks down a department into\n    teams. At this level of structure, the goals are very specific, relating to\n    just one element in overall business, like a marketing team responsible for\n    the success of a specific product.\n 4. Function. At the base of organizational structure are the individual\n    employees. Internal controls at this level will be task specific. A cashier\n    who fills out a form while counting their drawer in and out supports the\n    control of cash receipts.\n\nHow Routable makes cash controls easier\n 1. Vendor onboarding for data accuracy. Knowing for certain that your business\n    has the information it needs to file taxes, pay for services, and connect\n    with vendors reduces risks of overpayment, fraud, and communication gaps.\n 2. Obtaining automated authorized approvals. Customize stakeholder approval\n    chains and ensure that expenditures are in line with company goals and\n    guidelines.\n 3. Checking for duplicate payments by payers. AP automation provides accurate\n    and real-time documentation for vendor payments simplifying checks and\n    balances to prevent duplicate payments.\n 4. Generating electronic remittance advice (ERA) with paid invoice numbers. \n    Simplify accounting records with effective ERA, building confidence and\n    transparency with vendors.\n 5. Automatically reconcile payments in real-time. Two-way syncing with Routable\n    guarantees that balance sheet and bank statements reconcile in real-time.\n\nConclusion\nHaving the right internal controls in place helps to prevent wire transfer and\nbilling schemes, payroll and inventory theft, and even larceny. Understanding\nthe importance of internal controls for cash receipts as well as the principles\nprovided by the COSO framework, your business will have the advantage it needs\nto remain compliant with SEC and operate in confidence, securing the trust and\nsupport of stakeholders and investors.",

This type\nof accounting also helps detect fraud, prevent rampant spending, and increases\nbudget control.\n\nIncreased visibility\nBy carefully and accurately tracking your encumbrance amounts, you also increase\nspending visibility. It reduces unnecessary spending when tracked this way and\ncan help catch any fraudulent purchases more quickly. Overall, it can assist in\nmaking purchasing information more transparent and easily accessible when needed\nto enable tracking and overspending prevention.\n\nAccurate expenditure control\nEncumbrance data enables budgetary control, letting your company better\nunderstand where they are financially at any given time. Since the money that\nthe company will spend later is tracked, a company can keep from overspending.\nBy making visible the amount of money you plan on spending in the future, you\ncan more accurately see how much money you can spend on future projects or\npurchases without going over budget.\n\nWhile there are other ways to check this amount, such as checking your actual\nexpenses against your approved purchase orders or other factors, it is often\nless accessible and takes more work to see the exact number. In encumbrance\naccounting, that number is upfront and easy for any budgeting committee or CFO\nto examine.\n\nEnhanced analysis\nWhen you record encumbrance within your ledger, it makes budget data much more\naccessible. By tracking this information, financial analysis is easier to\nperform and a more accurate predictor. When your analysis is more precise, your\nestimated cash outflow will reflect your company's position more truly.\n\nConclusion\nLooking for other ways to increase your accounting's accuracy and analytics?\nConsider investing in automation tools like Routable\n[https://routable.com/payables].

AP teams can often play a role in relationships with vendors as well.</p><h2 id=\"accounts-payable-vs-accounts-receivable\">Accounts payable vs. accounts receivable</h2><p>While both core functions of accounting, accounts payable and <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/what-is-accounts-receivable/\">accounts receivable</a> are opposite in their roles. While the accounts payable department focuses on paying invoices and other bills, the accounts receiving department ensures that all incoming payments to the company are accurate and delivered on time. So, if a client was to buy an item or service from your company and you sent an invoice to them, the AR department would handle that workflow and tracking.</p><h2 id=\"is-accounts-payable-a-liability\">Is accounts payable a liability?</h2><p>Accounts payable are a liability account, and credits to them are considered company assets. That means that when using double-entry accounting, you will first debit the appropriate account you paid for your services, such as a purchasing account, then credit your AP account. Eventually, once you have paid for that purchase, you will debit your AP account and credit something like the company's cash account if you paid through a cheque. Other types of ledger accounts may be debited or credited, depending on the transaction and how your company paid it.</p><h2 id=\"ensuring-accuracy-with-three-way-match\">Ensuring accuracy with three-way match</h2><p>There are different ways that account payable departments check and match invoices. Some companies prefer to use two-way matching, which only involves matching an invoice with a purchase order, but other companies prefer <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/3-way-matching/\">three-way matching</a>. In three-way matching, you look at the invoice and compare it to the purchase order and the receiving report (alternatively, the goods receipt or order receipt). By checking these items against each other, you prevent fraudulent invoices and avoid human error.</p><h3 id=\"company-purchase-order\">Company purchase order</h3><p>A purchase order is a legally binding document that details the goods or services you want to buy. Often this document includes agreed-upon pricing, quantity, product details, and other factors that may be important to track. POs are helpful to you for tracking and help vendors when referencing your order to ensure you get the items or services you need.</p><h3 id=\"company-receiving-order\">Company receiving order</h3><p>Once you receive the order that you sent a purchase order for, you will fill out a receiving report or receiving order. This document should include the quantity of the item received, any needed details about the goods, and any notes of damage or issues with the shipment. Not all companies take the time to create receiving orders, meaning they often will use two-way matching rather than three-way matching.</p><h3 id=\"vendor-invoice\">Vendor invoice</h3><p>The vendor invoice is the invoice you receive for a set of goods and services. Comparing the vendor invoice to your purchase order is one of the essential steps to three-way matching, as discrepancies if found, are often between the agreed upon price and the price of the vendor invoice. The vendor invoice also helps you pay your bill to the vendor at the end of the process.</p><h3 id=\"three-way-match-exceptions\">Three-way match exceptions</h3><p>There are many different exceptions you may see within three-way matching. As mentioned previously, a common discrepancy is between the vendor invoice and the original purchase price. This exception often occurs due to shipping prices or taxes, which suppliers don't always include within the original pricing. You may see other abnormalities, such as over- or under-shipping, where you receive a different quantity from what you agreed upon, or honest data entry issues from the vendor within their invoice.</p><h2 id=\"why-internal-controls-are-important\">Why internal controls are important</h2><p>Internal controls are the processes put in place to help fight fraud and prevent inaccuracies. In an accounting department, these controls are absolutely essential to protect a company's assets and ensure compliance with federal, local, and state laws. As an accounting team, setting up a stringent set of internal controls ensures that your data is reliable for financial analytics and audits and prevents vendor and invoice fraud.</p><h3 id=\"preventing-paying-fraudulent-invoices\">Preventing paying fraudulent invoices</h3><p>Unfortunately, many criminals will attempt to trick companies with false invoices. Sometimes this is done by a company you have worked with, but it also can occur when a complete stranger sends an invoice to your company. The perpetrator hopes that your accounting department won't notice that they never ordered the goods or services within the invoice and will automatically pay the amount billed. By implementing even just two-way matching or other internal controls, you can easily spot these fraudulent invoices.</p><h3 id=\"spotting-inaccurate-invoices\">Spotting inaccurate invoices</h3><p>Another scenario that can occur is when you receive an invoice from a legitimate vendor that you ordered items from, but the invoice is inaccurate. This inaccuracy can be very harmless such as incorrect data entry, or it can, unfortunately, be malicious. By carefully comparing purchase orders with vendor invoices, you can prevent accidentally overpaying.</p><h3 id=\"preventing-invoice-double-payments\">Preventing invoice double payments</h3><p>Without proper protocols, accounting teams can accidentally double up on payments. Human error happens, especially if your workflow doesn't clearly communicate when a team member prepares to pay an invoice. Implementing software or internal control protocols to prevent this can keep your team from costly accidents.</p><h3 id=\"ensuring-all-vendors-are-paid-on-time\">Ensuring all vendors are paid on time</h3><p>Internal controls aren't only in place to prevent accidents or fraud. These steps can also help your team work more efficiently. It isn't hard to accidentally miss a vendor payment when overloaded with invoices and tasks. Internal controls can help implement guidelines and safeguards to ensure your vendors are paid consistently and on time.</p><h2 id=\"setting-up-internal-processes-to-reduce-risk\">Setting up internal processes to reduce risk</h2><p>There are a few ways that setting up internal control processes can reduce risks for your company. Unfortunately, sometimes those risks are internal rather than external. By setting up a few carefully planned internal processes, you can help prevent highly damaging fraud.</p><h3 id=\"segregation-of-duties\">Segregation of duties</h3><p>A standard internal process for accounting is called the segregation of duties. This process divides your team into having one of three roles: tracking assets, having custody over assets, and authorizing asset use. By separating these specific roles, you not only are making sure there is oversight anytime you use these assets but prevent internal fraud through the separation of power.</p><h3 id=\"vouchers\">Vouchers</h3><p>Vouchers help prevent unapproved cash withdrawals. When new supplies are needed, purchases go through a document-backed voucher system to ensure that employees can't order items without approval and that all cash transactions go through the correct channels. Vouchers are essential, especially for companies that commonly require large department orders so that branches aren't ordering without going through the proper official channels.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>Accounting teams process payments using either manual data entry or accounting software that assists in this process. <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/why-you-should-automate-your-ap-process/\">AP automation</a> can help employees keep more accurate track of expenses and cash flow and can help automatically pay invoices by their due dates.

While you can have some of the most skilled workers in the world, everyone makes the occasional mistake. To help improve your employees' workflows and streamline their processes, first talk to your team about their pain points. Consider where things seem to go awry, and find ways to help improve these problems now that you have identified them. Most likely, manual entry is a large time-sink for your team, something that <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/5-reasons-cfos-should-automate-accounts-payable/\">AP software can help you automate</a>.</p><h3 id=\"2-organize-ap-digitize-data\">2. Organize AP &amp; digitize data</h3><p>Electronic communication is already common, but unfortunately, <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/eft-payments/\">electronic payments</a> often lag behind. Consider encouraging the use of electronic data interchange (EDI) with vendors through <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/whats-the-difference-between-eft-and-ach-payments/\">ACH or other virtual payment methods</a>. Using digital payments in combination with integrated AP software can also help you with audit compliance and keeping accurate <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/audit-trails/\">audit trails</a>, helping you stay organized while protecting your company.</p><h3 id=\"3-improve-invoice-and-file-management\">3. Improve invoice and file management</h3><p>With unorganized <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/whats-the-difference-between-a-purchase-order-and-an-invoice/\">paper invoices, POs</a>, and piles of physical delivery receipts, the accounting office can get overwhelming, and it can be easy to lose vendor files and documents. The first step to cut down on these management issues is to use integrated software to track online payments and push for EDI (electronic data interchange). When virtual transactions are not possible, find software that allows you to easily upload physical invoices so you can keep things safe and organized, not lost in the paper pile of the back office.</p><h3 id=\"4-maintain-supplier-vendor-communication\">4. Maintain supplier &amp; vendor communication</h3><p>Clear and consistent communication with your suppliers and vendors helps upkeep your relationships and attain stronger ties within your supply chain. By having open communications with your vendors about payments and invoices, they are more likely to be open with you about any delays they may have or deals they can offer you. While delays are often unavoidable on both ends, being open and honest about it can avoid issues and frustrations in your <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/a-guide-to-vendor-management/\">vendor relationships</a>.</p><h3 id=\"5-go-after-early-payment-discounts\">5. Go after early payment discounts</h3><p>The faster and more consistently you pay your suppliers and vendors, the more likely you will be able to cash in on early payment discounts. Being on top of your payments can improve your relationships with vendors and save you money – for example, taking advantage of <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/what-does-2-10-net-30-mean/\">2/10 net 30 payment terms</a>.  Software that implements AP automation can help expedite your payment processes to hit that usual 10-day early payment timeframe, saving you money while also keeping you from ever worrying about late fees.</p><h3 id=\"6-limit-access-and-establish-controls\">6. Limit access and establish controls</h3><p>Creating detailed procurement controls helps reduce the risk of fraudulent behavior and guarantee compliance. Keeping limited access and requiring separation of duties makes fraud less likely, and protects your company from financial risk. Good controls such as <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/what-are-cash-controls/\">cash controls</a> also help make sure your data is accurate for better business, improved analytics, and audit preparedness.</p><h3 id=\"7-prioritize-invoices\">7. Prioritize invoices</h3><p>Invoices can get left to the side in place of other tasks. It is crucial to consider invoices high-priority to get early payment discounts, upkeep vendor relationships, and prevent debt and late fees. The longer you put off invoices, the bigger of a project they will be sorting through in the future.</p><h3 id=\"8-eliminate-ap-fraud\">8. Eliminate AP fraud</h3><p>Accounts payable fraud is unfortunately common. Even unintentionally, vendors may make a manual entry mistake that costs your company considerable amounts of money. Double-checking your invoices and payments, whether through automation or manually, is vital to prevent fraudulent charges. It only takes one dummy vendor to pull extreme amounts of money from your company.</p><h3 id=\"9-reduce-verification-and-signature-responsibility\">9. Reduce verification and signature responsibility</h3><p>Create workflows that prevent work for C-suite and executives as much as possible. While someone always has to sign the checks, that doesn't mean that they also have to take time out of their day to be involved in all parts of the process. Cut down on verification and signature responsibility through streamlined workflows and <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/new-configure-multiple-levels-of-approval-into-your-workflow/\">automated approval processes</a>.</p><h3 id=\"10-look-around-for-discounts\">10. Look around for discounts</h3><p>As you create relationships with vendors, take time to ask them about discount opportunities. Often to get early payment discounts and other offers, you have to dig and build relationships. Always be on the lookout for alternate vendors who may be in a better position to serve your company and its needs.</p><h3 id=\"11-automate-the-ap-process\">11. Automate the AP process</h3><p>By implementing automated solutions where manual, tedious work starts slowing down your employees, you can simplify their workflow while preventing errors. When your team uses <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/best-online-payment-software/\">AP automation solutions</a> to take over pain points in the accounting workflow, your team gets more time to focus on things like vendor relationships and balance sheet analytics. AP software can also assist in other areas, such as invoice management and simplifying approval workflows.</p><h3 id=\"12-check-for-duplicate-payments\">12. Check for duplicate payments</h3><p>Duplicate payments can happen due to poor workflow management and even just by honest mistake. Taking the time to check for accidental payments can help your company save money, especially when it is easy to accidentally pay that second copy of the invoice you accidentally were sent! Use cross-checking and <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/3-way-matching/\">3-way matching</a> to ensure that payments are accurate and never made more than once.</p><h3 id=\"13-follow-up-on-uncashed-checks\">13. Follow-up on uncashed checks</h3><p>When you have to use checks, make sure to follow up on them if the vendor doesn't cash them for an extraordinary amount of time. Unfortunately, it is easy for these paper payment methods to get lost in the mail, or worse, stolen. Vendors will appreciate your follow-up, and it will prevent any issues with late payments on your end if the check never arrived.</p><h3 id=\"14-reconcile-all-accounts-daily\">14. Reconcile all accounts daily</h3><p>Daily may seem like a lot, but this is extremely vital to notice any issues or discrepancies as early as possible. If you catch something early on, it is much easier to reach out and handle the problem. Delaying can mean that the issue never is entirely resolved and can look very unprofessional.</p><h3 id=\"15-delegate-work-to-more-than-one-touchpoint\">15. Delegate work to more than one touchpoint</h3><p>It is always better to have a backup plan in the case of unexpected absences or critical issues. Ensuring that you have secondary touchpoints in case of sudden employee illness or less predictable situations such as larger-scale disruptions can help prevent your company from suddenly being unable to complete vital AP work. While balancing this with your controls and separation of duties, especially with small teams, consider how you would approach an employee being suddenly unavailable.</p><h3 id=\"16-review-contracts-regularly\">16. Review contracts regularly</h3><p>Often once a contract is signed, it never is looked at unless an issue arises. By reviewing your supplier contracts more regularly, you can ensure that there are no overpayments or discrepancies between agreed-upon rates and what vendors are charging.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>One of the easiest ways to help improve your best practices is by implementing AP automation software.

            "plaintext": "Communication and visibility are two of the most important aspects of long-term\nbuyer-to-supplier engagement. When exchanges of goods or services occur between\nthese two parties, the accuracy and timely supply of information make the\ndifference between simply completing an AP/AR cycle and fostering sustainable\nvendor relationships [__GHOST_URL__/a-guide-to-vendor-management/].\n\nWhat is a remittance?\nPayments made from a buyer to a supplier or contractor are known as remittance.\nThis term is generally reserved for electronic or online payments, and most\nspecifically payments made internationally. Whether the payment is made by a\nUS-based company to an overseas contractor or the money is sent by a migrant\nfarmer to their family in their country of origin, it is considered remittance. \n\nThe common denominator is that these payments are generally electronic funds\ntransfer (EFT [__GHOST_URL__/eft-payments/]), utilizing the Automated Clearing\nHouse (ACH [__GHOST_URL__/setting-up-ach-payments/]) and wire transfers\n[__GHOST_URL__/wire-transfer-vs-direct-deposit/]. Remittance payments are\ninitiated by a payer, processed by a third party, and received by a payee in\ntheir local currency. Remittance payments\n[__GHOST_URL__/what-is-payment-remittance/] are subject to fees at various steps\nin the process and include variable timelines depending on which method is used.\nBecause of this lag in time from when an invoice is sent and when a payee\nactually sees the funds in their account, any communication that occurs during\nthis time provides visibility to both parties.\n\nWhat is remittance advice?\nA common practice of communication while a payment is processing is known as\nremittance advice: documentation that provides detailed information about the\npayment. This information is sent by accounts payable employees to a payee to\nnotify that a payment has been initiated. The accounts receivable\n[__GHOST_URL__/what-is-accounts-receivable/] department relies on this\ninformation to track incoming payments as well as to correctly apply payments. A\ncheck stub is a familiar form of remittance advice: it is not the payment\nitself, but does provide the payee with data about the payment including\napplicable tax, if the payment was subject to deduction, and payer contact\ninformation.\n\nWhy is remittance advice used\nIn the medical field, there are specific HIPAA legal guidelines for electronic\nremittance advice (ERA) as it relates to the coding used to describe coverage\nand benefits to protect the privacy of a beneficiary. Medical billers will\ninclude remittance advice remark codes (RARC) , claim adjustment reason codes\n(CARC), and any patient responsibility (PR) that relates to a specific claim.\nHowever, in other business settings, there is nothing so formal. Remittance\nadvice is not a required document. The information is considered a courtesy from\npayer to payee. \n\nPayment processing can take anywhere from a few days up to weeks depending on\nthe payment method. Rather than leaving suppliers guessing if (or when) a\npayment has been processed, remittance advice provides an assurance that the\npayment is coming. While remittance advice is not to be considered confirmation\nof the payment itself, the information it provides helps both parties keep track\nof the payment in process. Further, remittance advice provides a vital document\nin a paper trail should an audit occur [__GHOST_URL__/audit-trails/]. Accounting\ndepartments can use this information to correct bookkeeping errors and to\ndetermine if a payer has an outstanding balance.\n\nWhat to include on a remittance advice slip\n 1. Payer’s name and address. AR will need to be able to determine what account\n    to apply the payment to. Subsidiaries and subcontractors should know ahead\n    of time if they need to identify the name of a parent or umbrella company.\n 2. Payee’s name and address. Ensuring that the legal business name of a\n    recipient is accurate helps to prevent delays in payments, confusion, and\n    even fraud. It is very critical to have the correct address if remittance\n    advice is being sent via email. If the information gets sent to a general\n    company email address, the AR team may not receive the information they\n    need.\n 3. Payment method. Identify to the payee the method of payment that was used\n    and make sure the method aligns with contractual obligation.\n 4. Payment amount. State the amount of the payment and include information on\n    whether the payment is a partial payment or if discounts or deductions were\n    applied.\n 5. Invoice number. This will help the AR team match up the payment to a\n    specific invoice. Knowing the applicable invoice number is imperative for\n    buyers who use the same vendor frequently.\n 6. Payment date. This is the date that the payment was initiated, and it helps\n    the AR team know when to begin to keep an eye out for the payment to arrive\n    or be deposited.\n 7. Estimated payment processing window. Payments have a processing window, and\n    providing payees with an estimated time they will receive their payment can\n    help to flag both parties if the payment isn’t received by the anticipated\n    date.\n\nTypes of remittance advice\nFormatting of remittance advice will be different based on payment method and\nbusiness practices. Here are some common examples.\n\n 1. Basic remittance advice. Simply put, remittance advice is any document that\n    communicates to a payee that the invoice they submitted has been approved\n    and that the payment has been initiated. Some businesses may choose to send\n    a paper remittance, or literal letter, to a payee stating the invoice is in\n    good order, the amount that will be paid, and to which invoice it should be\n    applied.\n 2. Removable invoice advice. Some companies’ invoices include a removable\n    document included as a portion of the invoice. This is known as removable\n    remittance advice. The vendor is indicating preferences for communication\n    when they receive a payment. AP teams can remove this document from the\n    invoice, fill in the information, and send the document with their payment.\n 3. Scannable remittance advice. Some businesses will provide remittance advice\n    that is formatted for digital capture providing ease to payees in their data\n    entry.\n\nHow to send remittance advice\nHow remittance advice is sent will depend on the payment method used and it is\nbest practice to align the two. Paper remittance advice is sometimes included\nwith a check payment when sending through the mail. This choice is slow and may\nstill leave payee’s in the dark as to where their payment is since the\nnotification itself is accompanying the payment. Email remittance advice is a\ndirect and fast choice for communicating to payees about EFT payments\n[__GHOST_URL__/eft-payments/] with information included in the body or attached\nto an email.\n\nConclusion\nIt may feel like this kind of communication is falling out of favor in a digital\nlandscape of dashboards and real-time data. Communication, however, is never a\nwaste of time or resources.

            "plaintext": "Paperless accounts payable processes can sound like an intimidating transition.\nIn an accounts payable department that is already pressed for deadlines, how are\nemployees supposed to handle an entirely new document management system and\nworkflow? Luckily, with technology such as batch document scanning and AP\nautomation software, moving to paperless invoice processing isn't nearly as\ndifficult as it seems, and the benefits quickly outweigh any hurdles during the\nswitch.\n\nAP teams [__GHOST_URL__/what-is-accounts-payable/] have found that moving into a\npaperless AP process has a huge host of positive effects on their workflow.\nGetting rid of paper invoices, purchase orders, approvals, checks, and other\nrelated documents not only saves employees time but saves the company money. AP\ndepartments can function more efficiently, avoid more risk, and more quickly\nvendor invoices through a more fully digital accounting system.\n\nWhy go with a paperless accounts payable system\nThere are a significant host of reasons why your accounting and business\nprocesses should consider moving to a paperless system. Streamlined workflows,\nmore visibility for audits, and faster approval processes are just a few reasons\nwhy a paperless platform can empower your team.\n\nReduce processing costs\nPaperless AP systems save companies significant amounts of money on processing\nand labor costs. Paper processing takes more time and costs more money due to\nthings like manual data entry and mailing items to suppliers. Some accounts\npayable automation software expedites this even further, not only allowing for\nmore effortless digital capturing but automatically using optical character\nrecognition (OCR) and data indexing to automate more of the electronic invoice\nprocesses.\n\nSave on storage costs\nCabinets and drawers full of paper can start to get expensive quickly. Off-site\nstorage can rack up hefty fees for your company, while storing these documents\nin-house takes up valuable space that your company can use for other purposes.\nOn top of physical storage pricing, consider the additional costs for the\ndestruction and handling of these documents and the risks associated with fully\nphysical documents without digital backups.\n\nFaster processing\nFully digital payment processes give you access to a selection of accounting\nsoftware that can help provide faster processing for your team. From direct\nintegration into your ERP to AP automation solutions, powerful technology can\nhelp your team efficiently process any document. As your team expedites vendor\ninvoices, your company can benefit from early payment discounts, smoother\ntransactions, and fewer late fees.\n\nBetter internal controls and compliance\nUsing paperless systems means automated tracking of approved invoices and other\napproval workflows. Digital audit trails [__GHOST_URL__/audit-trails/] are\ncollected for every transaction in real-time, and you can set permissions to\ncreate robust controls. A company can easily pull invoice data, not only helping\ncompanies have a more clear view of their cash flow but making audit compliance\neasy. There are no real ways to secure documents within a paper system, and\ndocuments like POs [__GHOST_URL__/purchase-requisiton-or-purchase-order/] can\neasily be misplaced, leading to compliance problems.\n\nHow a paperless accounts payables system works\nNow that you are aware of the benefits of a paperless AP system, you may be\nready to make the jump.

At Routable, we strive to build a\nproduct that fuels fast-growing companies to grow even faster and make payments\nless of a headache. We’re super excited to announce that now you can create and\nsend thousands of payments to multiple vendors with a simple CSV file upload. \n\nWith  CSV upload, you can:\n\n * Save countless hours spent processing large volumes of payments\n * Scale your payment process without a full API integration\n * Lower your operational costs\n\nSave countless hours spent processing large volumes of payments\nFor companies that send out thousands of payments a week to their vendors or gig\nworkers, manual AP processes can be tedious and time-consuming. There’s a lot of\npayments to add into your accounting software, various checks that need to be\nmade (Are there any duplicates? Are all of the payments approved? Are all the\nnumbers adding up?) which can take hours if done manually. \n\nRoutable’s CSV upload streamlines this entire process from start to finish.\nSimply format your payments into the appropriate CSV template. We’ll check for\nany duplicates and warn you before you upload them if there are any errors or if\nthings don’t add up properly. If you need to add any approvers, you’ll be\nprompted to add them at the end. We’ll also automatically map all your fields to\nyour accounting software (Xero, QuickBooks Online, and coming soon: NetSuite) so\nyou don’t have to. \n\nScale your AP process when you don’t have time for a full API integration\nAlthough our API integration can be one of the best ways to fully automate your\naccounts payable process, it’s not always feasible for all companies to start\nusing it right away. Maybe your engineering team doesn’t have the bandwidth, or\nyou don’t have enough resources. However, you don’t want to pay your vendors or\nsuppliers slowly – that will inhibit your company’s growth, and you’re growing\nfast. With CSV upload, you get the benefits of scaling your payments process\nquickly, even without using the API. \n\nLower your operating costs\nBest of all, you can do more without as many resources. The countless hours\nspent entering payments one by one can be expedited, freeing up your team to\nfocus on more important activities and less on manual data entry.\n\nHow to start using CSV upload\nIf you’re a current customer and want to start using CSV upload, it’s available\nnow for QuickBooks and Xero integrations, with a NetSuite integration on the\nway. Check out our support articles [https://docs.routable.com/en/] for more\ninformation on how to get started. \n\nIf you’re a new customer and you want to learn how Routable can help you scale\nfrom 500 to 100,000 payments a month, or you want to learn more about how our \nAPI [https://routable.com/roles/developer/] can scale your business even\nfurther, schedule a demo [https://offers.routable.com/blogdemo] with us.",

That’s why it’s also a good idea to have this person on the ground\nfloor of your ERP implementation team.\n\nStep 2: Identify your ERP needs\nOnce you’ve assembled a cross-functional implementation team under the guidance\nof a skilled controller, your next step is to determine what you need an ERP\nsystem to do for your company. All ERP solutions start with a central, shared\ndatabase that contains the information your business needs to handle core\nprocesses; this data repository provides benefits like real-time visibility,\nimproved internal controls, and smarter business intelligence.\n\nIn addition to a central database, ERP systems are composed of various modules\n[https://www.netsuite.com/portal/resource/articles/erp/erp-modules.shtml] that\naddress specific business requirements. Knowing which of your business processes\nare inefficient or throttling growth will help you prioritize which modules you\nneed first. Most companies begin with a finance module—a foundational element of\nevery ERP solution—to automate basic accounting tasks and deliver visibility\ninto cash flow.\n\nProduct-based companies may want to add modules for order and inventory\nmanagement, as well as supply chain management modules for manufacturing,\nprocurement, or warehouse management.

Typically, companies start by issuing a\nrequest for information (RFI) that tells vendors what they’re trying to\naccomplish and asks them to suggest solutions, followed by a detailed request\nfor proposal (RFP) or request for quote (RFQ).\n\nBefore you start approaching vendors, make a detailed checklist of questions to\nask about features, cost, deployment options (cloud ERP or on-premises ERP, or a\nhybrid), implementation, and how to integrate the ERP solution with your\nexisting systems.

Depending on\nyour company size, the level of customization and integration you need, and\nnumerous other factors, the project could take anywhere from three months to\nmore than a year, so your first move should be to identify a dedicated team\nleader within your organization who has strong project management skills to lead\nthe development of an ERP implementation roadmap\n[https://www.netsuite.com/portal/resource/articles/erp/erp-implementation-checklist.shtml]\n.\n\nA project leader is different from an executive sponsor, whose role is to ensure\nmanagement buy-in, adjust business priorities and marshal additional resources\nif needed.

If there are questions about the status of a payment or what may be causing a delay, that information is available and traceable. \\n* **Tracking**. Remittance data associated with a payment is important for the payer and payee so that they can track invoice information for each payment. SWIFT payment data includes many of these remittance details, reducing the amount of time it takes to reconcile.\\n* **Consistency**. Standardizing payment information globally means that the payment details are the same whether you’ve paid your Canadian vendor or German contractor. A consistent experience for all payees means less guesswork for your finance team, so they can foster faster, more reliable AP cycles over time.\\n\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"* **Uncertain lead time**. SWIFT international transfers can process within 24 to 48 hours but some can take up to five days. What’s more, delays introduced along the way can happen without warning, creating friction between the payer and payee. \\n* **Surprise costs**. Fees vary from bank to bank. That means costs for a SWIFT transfer will vary from payment to payment.

A primary player in\ninternational payments is SWIFT. Ahead, we’ll explain how a SWIFT payment works,\nhow to pay with SWIFT and whether making payments over the SWIFT network is the\nright solution for your business.\n\nWhat is the SWIFT payment system?\nFirst, let's go over some background on SWIFT. \n\nThe Society of Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, or SWIFT\n[https://www.swift.com/about-us], is a cooperative society of financial\ninstitutions that have a standardized system of communication. SWIFT provides\nservices that allow businesses and individuals to make cross-border payments\nwithin a fast, secure environment. SWIFT is used on every continent, in more\nthan 200 countries and territories connecting more than 11,000 financial\ninstitutions.\n\nSWIFT itself is not a bank and does not hold transaction funds or process\npayments. Instead, SWIFT provides the language and the messaging platform that\nbanks and other financial institutions use to communicate transaction details to\neach other.\n\nWho uses SWIFT?\nThe SWIFT payment system is made up of different categories of institutions\nincluding banks, clearing houses, corporations and brokers. To join the SWIFT\nnetwork, an institution undergoes a seven-step process that includes stringent\nsecurity measures to ensure safe transactions.\n\nSWIFT is commonly used in treasury markets, security transactions, foreign\nexchange (forex), clearing systems and depositories. You’ll see SWIFT within\nmany banking market infrastructures and security market infrastructures, among\nothers, because of  their specialized applications and tools targeted at\nspecific markets.\n\nNow, let's move on to SWIFT payments themselves and how they work. \n\nWhat is a SWIFT payment?\nA SWIFT payment is an international wire transfer\n[https://blog.routable.com/international-wire-transfer/] that’s carried out via\nthe SWIFT payment network. Banks work through the SWIFT system to communicate\ntransfer details and payment instructions.\n\nWhat is a SWIFT code?\nA SWIFT code identifies banks or other institutions involved in a SWIFT\ncross-border payment. Both initiating and receiving institutions have unique\nSWIFT codes. You cannot make a SWIFT payment without SWIFT codes.\n\nSWIFT codes are eight or 11-characters long and are made up of four main\nelements:\n\n 1. Bank Identifier Code (BIC). Four characters identifying a business in the\n    SWIFT network.\n 2. Country code. Two characters identifying the country the business operates\n    from.\n 3. Location code or city code. Two characters identifying the city the business\n    operates from.\n 4. Branch code. The last three characters, when used, identify a specific\n    branch.\n\nFor example, if you banked with Imagine Bank in Seattle, Washington, the SWIFT\ncode full form would look like this: IMAGUS6SSEA\n\n\n\n * BIC: IMAG\n * Country code: US\n * City code: 6S\n * Branch code: SEA\n\nUsing the correct codes for the corresponding banks is essential to how the\nSWIFT payment network functions. Similar to a routing number, you can easily\nidentify your bank’s SWIFT code online or through a quick phone call to your\nbank.\n\n💡Some online banking user platforms identify SWIFT codes right on their user\ndashboard. Banks may use different codes depending on the currency involved.\nConfirm the code with your bank before you pay with SWIFT to prevent payment\ndisruptions.Are SWIFT code and IBAN the same? \nNo, a SWIFT code and IBAN are not the same. Both SWIFT and IBAN (International\nBank Account Number) are used to complete international payments. However, IBAN\nis a standardized numbering system that helps identify a specific international\nbank account, while a SWIFT code identifies the institutions processing the\npayments. You'll likely need your recipient's IBAN to process a SWIFT payment. \n\nLearn more: What’s IBAN [__GHOST_URL__/what-is-iban/]?\n\nIBANs are sensitive business account numbers and should be kept secure. If\nyou’re making payments to an international entity or individual, they'll provide\nyour business with their IBAN when they fill out tax forms. SWIFT codes are\nreadily accessible to those choosing to make a payment through the SWIFT\nnetwork.\n\nHow a SWIFT payment works\nThere are generally three steps in the SWIFT payment process.\n\nStep 1: You collect the recipient’s banking information.\nProvide your bank with the recipient’s bank account number, usually an IBAN, and\ntheir bank’s SWIFT code in full form. You can send a SWIFT payment online or in\nperson depending on your bank.\n\n💡You can also conveniently make a SWIFT transfer directly within an accounts\npayable platform [https://routable.com/] when making B2B payments.Step 2: Your\nbank and the recipient’s bank communicate with one another via the SWIFT network\nto authenticate the payment.\nWhen both the receiving bank and the initiating bank receive the SWIFT message,\nthey’ll begin processing the payment. Both banks track the details into their\nown identical, special ledgers known as the Nostro and Vostro accounts\n[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/051815/what-difference-between-nostro-and-vostro-account.asp]\n.\n\nNostro translates into \"ours\" in Latin, as in \"our money that your bank has\ndeposited,\" while Vostro translates to \"Yours,\" as in \"your money that we have\ndeposited.\" If one of the banks does not have a connection to Nostro/Vostro\naccounts, intermediary banks act as an in-between for the bank that does not\nhave access. \n\nStep 3. The payee receives the payment.\nThe payee receives funds into their account in their local currency.\n\nHow a SWIFT payment works when both the initiating bank and receiving bank are\nwithin the SWIFT networkHow long does a SWIFT international transfer take?\nTransfers through the SWIFT payment network take one to five business days. The\ntime it takes to transfer is affected by two main factors: regulatory compliance\nand interconnectivity.\n\nRegulatory compliance. Not all banks have the same fraud prevention and\nanti-money laundering procedures (AML), and the differences result in varying\ntransfer times. \n\nInterconnectivity. Additionally, not all banks are directly connected to the\nSWIFT network. Banks that do have a direct agreement will transfer money faster.\nTransfers that require one or more intermediary banks to complete the transfer\ntake longer.\n\nWhen banks aren't connected to the SWIFT network, they get help from\nintermediary banks to complete make the transfer.SWIFT fees: How much does it\ncost to make a SWIFT payment?\nThere are two main fees that occur with a SWIFT payment:\n\n 1. Transaction fees. SWIFT fees are determined by each bank or institution\n    involved. There is a wide range of transaction fees. Outgoing transactions\n    (where you are initiating the payment) are generally higher than incoming\n    transactions (where you are receiving an international payment).\n 2. Foreign exchange fee. When one currency is exchanged for another, foreign\n    exchange rates apply. Banks charge a service fee to exchange one currency\n    for another. Average exchange rate fees are 3 to 5% of the overall payment\n    amount.\n\nWho pays the SWIFT fees?\nFinancial institutions pay fees to SWIFT to participate in the network and use\nthe messaging system. Each bank determines how to pass these fees on to their\nclients.\n\nThere are three options a payer and payee can choose to cover SWIFT fees: \n\n 1. OUR. The payer agrees to cover all of the fees associated with the payment.\n    The payer is billed separately and the payee receives the payment in full.\n 2. BEN (short for Beneficiary). The payee agrees to cover the SWIFT fees. The\n    payee receives the payment with all associated fees.\n 3. SHA (short for Shared). Both the payer and payee cover the costs of the\n    transfer. The payer covers the initiating costs while the payee covers the\n    receiving and conversion rate fees.\n\nThe option you choose to cover SWIFT fees is documented in the details of the\npayment so that both parties are clear about who is responsible for what. This\nmay be a conversation to have ahead of time so there are no surprises.\n\nIs SWIFT payment right for your business?\nMaking payments internationally can be tricky and expensive if you don’t have\nthe right tools. Cross-border payments introduce challenges that aren’t found in\ndomestic payments, including language barriers, country-specific regulations and\ntime zone differences.\n\nRecommended reading: A guide to cross-border payments\n[https://blog.routable.com/cross-border-payments-guide/].\n\nUsing SWIFT to transfer funds significantly reduces many of the major barriers\nto making a successful cross-border payment.\n\nThe top benefits of sending SWIFT payments\n * Transparency. The very nature of SWIFT is standardized communications. All\n   parties involved in a SWIFT payment have access to the same information. If\n   there are questions about the status of a payment or what may be causing a\n   delay, that information is available and traceable.\n * Tracking. Remittance data associated with a payment is important for the\n   payer and payee so that they can track invoice information for each payment.\n   SWIFT payment data includes many of these remittance details, reducing the\n   amount of time it takes to reconcile.\n * Consistency. Standardizing payment information globally means that the\n   payment details are the same whether you’ve paid your Canadian vendor or\n   German contractor. A consistent experience for all payees means less\n   guesswork for your finance team, so they can foster faster, more reliable AP\n   cycles over time.\n\nRelated reading: Paying foreign independent contractors [paying foreign\nindependent contractors]\n\nChallenges using SWIFT payments\nWhile SWIFT is quickly improving the end-to-end experience of international wire\ntransfers, there are still a few challenges that stem from the banks involved in\nthe SWIFT payments. \n\n * Uncertain lead time. SWIFT international transfers can process within 24 to\n   48 hours but some can take up to five days. What’s more, delays introduced\n   along the way can happen without warning, creating friction between the payer\n   and payee.\n * Surprise costs. Fees vary from bank to bank. That means costs for a SWIFT\n   transfer will vary from payment to payment. Not being able to assess fees and\n   lead times at the outset of the transaction leaves a pretty big gray area in\n   payment communications. Working with major banks that have direct agreements\n   overseas helps to mitigate these challenges. However, if intermediary banks\n   are necessary to complete a SWIFT payment, the fees and transfer times will\n   add up.\n\nLearn more about how SWIFT is making improvements to payment speeds and offering\nmore robust data here\n[https://www.swift.com/about-us/our-future/frictionless-instant-payments].\n\nHow to pay with SWIFT using Routable\nYou can send SWIFT payments via your bank, but it doesn’t offer a cohesive look\ninto all of your cross-border payments. \n\nUsing a payment platform like Routable lets you send SWIFT payments from the\nsame place where you manage all of your B2B payments, whether they’re local or\ninternational. Routable integrates with your existing accounting software to\nkeep your workflow efficient and simple, offering real-time, two-way sync so\nthat you know exactly what you’ve paid, when you paid and to whom. You’ll also\nhave access to flexible fees and the ability to seamlessly scale as your\nbusiness grows with a single CSV upload for high-volume payments.\n\nLearn more about how Routable makes cross-border payments easy\n[https://routable.com/payables/cross-border-payments].",

Today, the <a href=\"https://www.webretailer.com/b/online-marketplaces/#United_States\">Top 10 Online Marketplaces</a> in the US include highly recognizable names and brands like Etsy, Overstock, and eBay. This convenience was made essential to daily life during 2020 where global economies saw surges in online shopping. Indeed, projections show the growth rate of e-commerce will surpass $6 trillion by 2023. </p><p>From a consumer facing perspective: Online marketplaces offer the experience of being at a local creator expo, while enjoying the support of a personal shopper whose sole responsibility is securing items of your personal interest, with the assurance that once it is time to purchase, the process is fast, efficient, and informative—all from the comfort of bubble bath, glass of rosé in hand. </p><p>On the backend of the consumer’s shopping experience, however, is a carefully curated catalog of retailers, vendors and artists who want to be seen by consumers, paid in a timely manner, and feel supported by the marketplace customer service teams when needed. </p><p>In other words, an online marketplace company is an opportunity for independent producers to access large and diverse demographics that would otherwise not be available to them. Marketplaces bring together suppliers, in a digital landscape, much like a physical shopping center. However, on a digital landscape, the marketplace company functions as a payment gateway, as well as a purchasing platform, providing the security of processing electronic payments and taking on complex compliance responsibilities.</p><h2 id=\"three-unique-challenges-for-marketplace-companies\">Three unique challenges for marketplace companies</h2><h3 id=\"1-manual-payments\">1. Manual payments</h3><p>Manually navigating payments includes tedious data entry for numerous purchases made with various payment types. Unfortunately, the introduction of errors and duplications into an ERP or financial data system is inevitable with manual data entry. Further, manual processes are susceptible to inefficiencies and fraud throughout AP cycles as well as vulnerabilities to missed or lost documentation.</p><h3 id=\"2-keeping-vendors-happy\">2. Keeping vendors happy</h3><p>Vendors, retailers, artists—they desire assurance that the platforms they are using are consistent,  a fine balance between being compensated for their work and feeling heard should issues arise. Strong vendor relationships start with successful onboarding. Gaps in vendor information can have a domino effect on communication the longer the relationship persists. Add to that ineffective communication channels and both the marketplace company and the vendor can be left in the dark on task management and follow-through.</p><h3 id=\"3-volume-of-payments\">3. Volume of payments</h3><p>For each vendor that a marketplace company supports, there are multiple payments that need to be processed; a volume that compounds with every new seller that joins the marketplace. Processing those payments requires collecting taxes, staying in compliance with data security regulations, as well as tracking and follow-up communications with both consumers and retailers. Overwhelmed AP teams are more susceptible to data entry errors and missed documentation resulting in unsatisfied consumers and ultimately seller attrition.</p><h2 id=\"address-challenges-early-and-scale-faster\">Address challenges early and scale faster</h2><p>Marketplace companies benefit from expanding their catalog but find themselves in a singular bottleneck if a payment system does not scale. Foreseeing these issues and establishing best practices provides a strategic advantage that both encourages catalog growth as well as sets your teams up for success.</p><h2 id=\"vendor-payouts-become-increasingly-difficult-as-you-add-more-vendors\">Vendor payouts become increasingly difficult as you add more vendors</h2><p>You should never have to delay or stall onboarding additional retailers, vendors, or artists as a result of ineffective payment systems. Yet, the complexity of being able to successfully pay myriad vendors—each on time, each with their unique needs—can feel like an insurmountable barrier, especially once a marketplace reaches 1000 vendors.</p><p>With the right payment automation, AP teams are able to onboard, track, and update vendors—and their payments—within the confines of a secure, reliable, and consistent platform. In this way, new vendors are met with the same enthusiasm as the very first sellers rather than being a frustration to a distracted accounting department. The system itself is designed to accommodate larger volumes of data processing, leaving AP teams to more vital tasks that require a personal touch.</p><h2 id=\"prioritize-your-payout-experience-sooner-rather-than-later\">Prioritize your payout experience sooner rather than later</h2><p>Vendors and people care deeply about being paid quickly, without issues. Having the right system in place before vendor payment processing reaches an unmanageable volume makes a difference in seller retention and consumer satisfaction. </p><p>Consumers want access to products, vendors want their products seen and acquired.

            "plaintext": "With the rise of global commerce, it has become more and more common to contract\nhelp located in another country. There can be many benefits to hiring foreign\ncontractors. Your business could benefit from drastically different points of\nview, and the cost benefits can't be ignored either. The hold up for many\nbusinesses is that conducting business and operating a staff overseas brings its\nown host of complications. No matter where your staff is located, just down the\nblock or across the pond, compensating them in a secure timely matter is one of\nthe premier responsibilities of any employer. But with international contractors\nand freelancers, it is never as simple as just paying talent an hourly wage.\nWith local law, exchange rates, income tax, and other tax obligations all coming\ninto play, international borders can make B2B payments\n[https://blog.routable.com/intro-to-b2b-payments/] tricky.\n\nWhat most of the big companies know is that the benefits definitely outweigh the\ncosts in the long term. Getting to a place where both employer and staff feel\nsecure in their international payments begins with understanding the options and\nintricacies of international compensation. During a time when many of the older,\ntrusted methods are being challenged by newer, sleeker tools, taking the time to\nexplore your options is more important than ever.\n\nPayment methods for paying international contractors & freelancers\nSo, what is the best method for paying international contractors and\nfreelancers? Most businesses will need to weigh the pros and cons of the\ndifferent methods individually and decide on what best fits their needs.\n\nRelated reading: A guide to cross-border payments\n[https://blog.routable.com/cross-border-payments-guide/]\n\nPayment apps (PayPal, Transferwise, etc.)\nPayment apps like PayPal are a money transfer service. They shuttle funds from\none user to another through their own payment intermediaries.\n\nThe pros of paying via payment apps\n1. Convenience\nWith most features and transfers available from the user's phone, this is the\nflagship benefit of payment apps. Most have simple, intuitive interfaces,\nmeaning much of the difficulty is centered around creating profiles or getting\nthe recipient to create a profile in order to receive or initiate the transfer.\nYou don't even need bank account info, just the email used to create the\nprofile.\n\n2. Speed \nUnlike some of the methods we'll discuss below, most of the transfers and\nfeatures are, for most purposes, basically instant. The transfer can be\ncompleted and the recipient is able to spend the funds in a matter of minutes.\n\nThe cons of paying via payment apps\nIt's no secret that online payment apps are fast and convenient. So what's\nstopping businesses everywhere from instituting these as the standard payment\nmethod for their companies?\n\n1. Matching accounts \nIn the majority of cases, the sender and recipient must have a profile on the\nsame payment app. Domestically this doesn't pose as tall of a hurdle.\nInternationally, however, this can be a big problem. Many payment apps, even\nPayPal, are not allowed in certain countries. Some don't do international\npayments at all.\n\n2. Cryptic fees\nPayment apps suffer from hard to understand invoices. PayPal syndrome describes\nthe pain of decoding an invoice for a transfer that somehow ends up costing much\nmore than expected. Even though many of the accounts are free to set up (PayPal\ndid a promotion where they paid new users $10, even), it doesn't mean that the\nprocess itself is free. There can be business fees which are often a combo of\npercent and flat deductions whenever you sell or transfer funds. There can be\nexchange rate fees in which you are charged to exchange money, such as from USD\nto the Euro, and the recipient pays fees upon receiving the funds as well. All\nof these fees add up to be a heavy blow on everyone's bottom line.\n\n3. Speed \nThe speed of these apps is a blessing and a curse. While the funds can arrive\ninstantly, they may not be accessible to the recipient for days after. The apps\ngenerally take up to three days for the money to be deposited. This discrepancy\nbetween money received and money accessible can make the waiting all the more\npainful. The recipient can pay a fee to transfer the funds instantly, or many\napps offer a debit card attached to their online funds to bypass the waiting\ntimes. However, many places do not accept the cards as payment yet, and in many\ncases, there are additional fees associated with the cards use if they are\ncredit.\n\nInternational wire transfers for foreign workers\nInternational wire transfers have shown up in movies and tv for decades, and the\nline \"Wire me the money\" has made this a well-known payment option. Most often,\nbank wire payments will go from your bank to your recipient's bank through the\nSociety for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or SWIFT\n[https://blog.routable.com/how-swift-payments-work/], network. Because\ninternational money transfers often use this network, international wires will\noften be called SWIFT transfers\n[https://blog.routable.com/how-swift-payments-work/].\n\nThe SWIFT [__GHOST_URL__/how-swift-payments-work/] network is\ncomprised of more than 10,000 financial institutions. It was developed in\nBrussels in 1973 as a way of sharing common processes and standards for\nfinancial transactions, as well as information of the financial transactions\nthemselves, between the more than 200 countries participating including France,\nArgentina, Canada, and the UK.\n\nThe pros of paying via international wire\n1. Easy \nThe great majority of American banks are able to do international transfers with\ncontractors or suppliers, even if international banking isn't their forte. This\nmeans that most people will not need to change banks or sign-up for any\nadditional programs. If you're working with a financial institution you trust,\nthis can be a great boon. Also, the transfer will go directly into your target's\nbank account in their destination country. Which most likely means your staff\nwon't have to jump through any hoops to have access to their deposit.\n\n2. Secure \nBanks have a long history of being safe and secure. They are held to high\nstandards and have incredibly tight insurance. Their size and standing as a\npermanent establishment protect you and your workers from the misfortune of\nimproperly protected funds.\n\n3. High limits \nBanks are set up for handling large amounts of money. Often they won't bat an\neye even if you're sending your whole full-time payroll overseas.\n\nThe cons of paying via international wire\nWhile SWIFT transfers have been a staple for many years, there are still some\nparts that have not aged well. Many things that used to be perks have lagged far\nenough behind to be considered a drawback. Here are some downsides:\n\n1. Fees\n These are major drawbacks in a couple of different ways.

The more effectively you complete this step, the better chance your project has of being successful.</p><h3 id=\"what-is-an-erp-anyway\">What is an ERP, anyway?</h3><p>But first it’s worth taking a step back to <a href=\"https://www.netsuite.com/portal/resource/articles/erp/what-is-erp.shtml\">redefine ERP</a> so that everyone in your organization is on the same page when it comes to expectations about what an ERP system can accomplish. ERP software became popular in the 1990s when companies saw that automating business processes increased efficiency by leaps and bounds. By providing organization-wide visibility, businesses were also able to make better decisions.</p><p>Today’s ERP systems manage almost every aspect of day-to-day business operations, including accounting, procurement and purchasing, risk management, compliance, and supply chain operations.

They unify an organization’s people, processes, and technology.</p><p>All ERP solutions have a shared, central database that pulls from multiple sources of a company's data, including general ledger (GL), accounts payable, accounts receivable, payroll and financial reporting. Employees from accounting and manufacturing to sales and HR can thus rely on a “single source of truth” and real-time information. Leaders benefit from cross-departmental visibility that allows them to analyze different scenarios, create accurate forecasts, streamline processes, and increase efficiency.</p><h3 id=\"why-fortune-1000-companies-rely-on-erp-systems\">Why Fortune 1000 companies rely on ERP systems</h3><p>Because ERP systems allow employees to spend less time searching for the data they need, they often result in cost savings and better productivity. Large companies, particularly those in the Fortune 1000, have been relying on ERPs for the last 25 years, most using on-premises systems that run on servers they own. These enterprise ERP systems capture vast amounts of data and handle multiple business units. But with the advent of cloud-based ERP, more and more large enterprises are moving their systems to cloud, hybrid, or two-tier ERP platforms that better position the organization for growth.</p><p>For Fortune 1000 companies—and increasingly, mid-size and even smaller businesses—ERP systems have become table stakes for using resources wisely. ERP helps leaders:</p><ul><li>Reallocate human and financial capital</li><li>Build more efficient processes without sacrificing quality or performance</li><li>Improve planning by giving employees visibility into inventory, customer orders, and forecasted demand</li><li>Improve communication and collaboration between departments.</li></ul><p>The in-depth reports and analytics possible with ERP systems also translate immense amounts of data into charts and graphics that illustrate trends and aid decision-making.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-identify-what-an-erp-system-can-do-for-you\">How to identify what an ERP system can do for you</h3><p>Now that you have an idea of the overarching benefits of ERP software, it’s time to drill down into your company’s specific requirements. An ERP implementation is an opportunity to introduce better processes, not just automate inefficient ones. Choosing the wrong ERP solution can be costly, so <a href=\"https://www.netsuite.com/portal/resource/articles/erp/erp-requirements.shtml\">gathering and prioritizing your ERP requirements</a> in advance increases the probability of success.</p><p>To help you build a list of key business needs, identify who an ERP system will affect, then talk to stakeholders across your organization. Analyze current systems and processes. Maybe your accounting software can’t handle multi-entity accounting or connect to your inventory software. Or maybe your company is growing so fast that your team is swamped with manual tasks instead of spending their time on more valuable activities.</p><p>“The company was growing and adding multiple subsidiaries, and QuickBooks couldn’t handle our consolidations,” said the vice president of finance at a healthcare company. “That’s when I knew we had to switch to an ERP.”</p><p>You’ll also want to outline the goals for the implementation.

Identify your must-have functionality, as well as a “want list.”</p><p>Knowing which of your business processes are inhibiting growth will help you prioritize which ERP modules you need first. Most companies begin with a finance module—a foundational element of every ERP solution—to automate basic accounting tasks and deliver visibility into cash flow. You might also need modules for order and inventory management, supply chain management, e-commerce, professional services automation (PSA), human resources, or customer relationship management (CRM).</p><p>Below are three tips for identifying your ERP requirements.</p><h3 id=\"1-avoid-the-dreaded-scope-creep-\">1. Avoid the dreaded “scope creep”</h3><p>It’s important to prioritize capabilities within those modules to stay focused on your business goals and avoid getting distracted by flashy features. While no one will know your business like you and your project team, you might want to consider working with an experienced knowledgeable ERP expert who can help you confirm that your project is scoped appropriately and determine what kind of customizations, workflows, and integrations you need. Most vendors’ professional services organizations have consultants and project managers with extensive experience implementing their solution. Ask your ERP provider which parts can be implemented in steps, with the most critical features to be set up first. You should decide which business processes are critical in phase 1, then move down the list of priorities with future features.

            "html": "<p>Being able to reach consumers, guests, clients, attendees—anywhere, at any time—is the foundation for why online payments have become very high-demand. Today, businesses can order office supplies from the couch, approve vendor payments while on the bus, or finalize procurement purchases late at night from their dining room table. Indeed, the number of consumers who use more than one type of digital payment has grown from <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/banking-matters/us-digital-payments-achieving-the-next-phase-of-consumer-engagement\">45% to 58% </a>between 2019 and 2020; a staggering difference from only 2% increase between 2018 and 2019. For businesses embracing the future of commerce, having an effective electronic payment system keeps their operation relevant and accessible, providing a strategic edge to competition in a vast e-commerce landscape.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-an-electronic-payment-system\">What is an electronic payment system?</h2><p>An electronic payment system is the network of sending and receiving digital payments for online transactions. Also known as an e-payment system or an online payment system, the electronic payment system includes both the purchaser’s interface—payment options, online shopping carts, and identity verification—as well as the supplier’s AP processing, remittance, and vendor management.</p><h3 id=\"how-do-electronic-payments-work\">How do electronic payments work?</h3><p>One way electronic payments are made is by using the national Automated Clearing House network to digitally transfer funds from one bank account into another. On the surface, the process is designed to feel effortless, but there are a lot of steps along the way that a payment encounters before a payment is formally complete.</p><p>To illustrate, let’s use the example of an online marketplace that curates vendors who produce local, handcrafted items. The marketplace, or merchant, attracts customers, or cardholders, to their website. When a cardholder purchases a one-of-a-kind ceramic vase for their mother’s birthday, they enter the credit debit or credit card information provided to them by their issuer, usually their bank. This information is then used by a merchant’s merchant account provider, or acquirer, who will either approve or deny the payment. A payment processor is used to move the funds from one account to another and a payment gateway is used to ensure the transaction is encrypted, utilizing the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards with (PCI DSS)  secure socket layer (SSL) technology. Once a payment has been finalized it is directly deposited into the merchant’s account, usually within 3-5 business days. With an effective electronic payment system, the merchant can then make payments to their vendors, directly depositing funds with ACH transactions.</p><h3 id=\"one-time-recurring-payments\">One-time &amp; recurring payments</h3><p>The versatility of electronic payments meets the demand of the diverse e-commerce environment. For examples like the online marketplace, consumers can provide electronic payment information at the time of purchase in a secure data capture. One-time payment information can also be safely stored for repeat purchases, making it easier for customers to return, login, and use the same payment information. This secure capture and storing of payment information is also vital to businesses that use recurring subscription or subscription-like services. By offering an automated payment plan option, users can rest assured that important utility bills or car payments never lapse.</p><p>Types of electronic payments include:</p><ul><li>Credit or Debit Card, <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/virtual-credit-cards/\">virtual cards</a>, and the chip technology to “tap”</li><li><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/what-is-an-ach-direct-deposit/\">Direct Deposit</a></li><li>eWallet</li><li>Contactless payments</li><li><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/what-is-an-ach-direct-deposit/\">ACH</a></li><li><a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/ach-vs-wire-transfer-which-is-better-for-your-company/\">Wire Transfers</a></li><li>eChecks</li></ul><h3 id=\"are-electronic-checks-safe\">Are electronic checks safe?</h3><p>As a type of <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/eft-payments/\">electronic fund transfer (EFT)</a>, the umbrella term used for digital payments, electronic checks (eChecks) are much safer than a physical check.

Physical check transactions can run upwards of $20 per check depending on the type of paper used, the financial institutions processing the payment, and where the checks are being processed. Payments made using the ACH, however, range from $.20-$1.50 with a tendency to average out at $.50 per transaction.

Consider initial and ongoing costs\nAn ERP system is one of the largest investments a company can make. As you\nconsider different ERP offerings, make sure you understand the initial price\ntag.\n\nBut how do you know what a good initial price tag looks like? Typically, your\nfirst year contract should include:\n\n * Recurring license and user costs. Is it user-based, module-based, or both?\n   Typically SaaS solutions are a hybrid of both, but make sure to get\n   clarification on this.\n * Implementation costs. Is the price fixed, or based on time and material?\n\nAlso, make sure you understand the total cost of ownership. Don’t forget to\nfactor in subscription and integration costs for the remainder of your systems\nlandscape.\n\nBy the same token, remember that an ERP system is an investment that will be a\nhuge part of your business for many years to come.\n\n“When we started looking for an ERP system, we wanted one that could grow with\nus, so that in 20 years, we don’t have to spend a lot of money to get a new ERP\nand all the headaches that come with transitioning systems,” says Antonio\nCorona, director of finance at Kasa [https://kasa.com/], which chose NetSuite\nfor its ERP system.\n\nThink seriously before choosing a new, unproven system simply because it’s the\ncheapest, rather than a solution from a vendor with years of successful\nexperience. Ask about:\n\n * Implementation costs. Every ERP implementation is different. Make sure you\n   know if there are aspects of your project that might result in additional\n   costs.\n * Subscription costs. If you’re considering a cloud-based ERP system managed by\n   a third-party, understand the cost structure: upfront costs, monthly costs,\n   and the cost of changes.\n * Maintenance and updates.

An ERP consultant can help you evaluate and negotiate\ncosts.\n\n3. Evaluate how your potential ERP vendor handles implementation\nERP implementation projects may seem daunting, but with the right vendor and\npartners, they can go very smoothly. Take the time to find out how a potential\nvendor handles implementation. How will they translate your business processes\ninto automated workflows? This level of granularity is key to document.\n\nOf course, your implementation plan will be based in large part on your\ndeployment model. The implementation of an on-premises ERP system, where a\ncompany runs the ERP software on its own infrastructure, is going to look much\ndifferent than the deployment of a cloud ERP system that runs on the vendor’s\nservers.\n\n“For us, a big highlight of NetSuite is that it’s a cloud service,” says Corona,\n“It’s not specific to Kasa and doesn’t have to live on our servers. We don’t\nhave a traditional IT team, so we don’t have a lot of bandwidth to maintain the\nsystem.”\n\nVendors have a vested interest in ensuring the success of your ERP\nimplementation, which is why the majority have professional services\norganizations that have extensive experience implementing their solution in\ndifferent industries, and for unique business requirements. For example, Oracle\nNetSuite offers SuiteSuccess\n[https://www.netsuite.com/portal/services/professional-services/suitesuccess.shtml]\n, a methodology for NetSuite implementations that builds on expertise amassed\nover two decades. NetSuite adopted the SuiteSuccess methodology to allow for\n<100 day implementations, which drives faster ROI for their clients.\n\nAlso take into consideration the makeup of your in-house ERP implementation team\n[https://www.netsuite.com/portal/resource/articles/erp/erp-implementation-team.shtml]\n. If your company doesn’t have a deep “bench” with an experienced controller,\nyou might consider availing yourself not only of a vendor’s professional\nservices team but a third-party integration partner as well.\n\n4. Consider bringing in an integration partner\nOne of the most important selection criteria in choosing an ERP system is how\nwell it integrates with the financial systems, applications and hardware you\nalready have. In other words, the system needs to play well with others. See\nwhether the solution has open application programming interfaces (APIs) to\nfacilitate integration with custom and commercial solutions. If it can’t\nintegrate easily with, say, the scanners you use in your warehouse or business\npayments software like Routable [https://routable.com/], you need to know that\nup-front.\n\n“It was important for us to have a system that had good API connectivity,” says\nCorona. “This lets us remain dynamic and fluid as our business grows. NetSuite\nhas developed APIs with a lot of other SaaS tools that are specific to\naccounting. A big win for us was being able to connect our revenue automation.”\n\nIf you know that your business has important integrations that need to be part\nof an ERP implementation, start reviewing potential integration partners as part\nof your ERP selection process. These firms can give you expert advice.\n\nFor example, companies like Business Solution Partners [https://www.bspny.com/] \nthat are part of the NetSuite Solution Provider Program\n[https://www.netsuite.com/portal/partners/solution-program.shtml] deliver\ncomplete NetSuite solutions, from NetSuite licenses to implementation and\nsupport.

            "plaintext": "When trading between financial institutions domestically, we often have to gain\naccess to that person or company's basic bank account number in order to send\nmoney safely and accurately to the recipient. Having the specific bank account\ncode helps money get to the right hands without any worry or transactional\nerrors. While the domestic process is pretty upfront, what about when making\ninternational money transfers? In these cases, you use a similar number called\nan International Bank Account Number.\n\nWhat is an International Bank Account Number (IBAN)?\nInternational Bank Account Numbers (IBANs) are an international standard for\nbank identifier codes, helping international organizations accurately send\noverseas transactions. The IBAN format works to specify additional information\nto the already existing bank code so that there isn't confusion when trying to\nmake international money transfers. Different countries have different\nrequirements for their International Bank Account Numbers, but even with these\nvariations, the IBAN system simplifies cross-country financial transactions.\n\nHow many digits is an IBAN?\nUnder ISO standards, the full fixed-length IBAN code is up to 34 alphanumeric\ncharacters long and can sometimes be structured with different elements\ndepending on the country's standards. Some countries will have much longer\nnumbers within this limit, while others will be quite short. Some IBANs include\nAccount Numbers, Account Types, and Owner Numbers, while others just use a few\nidentifiers. Using a generic French bank as an example:\n\n * ISO Country Code: This is always a two-letter country code in upper-case\n   letters, such as FR (France).\n * IBAN Check Digits: These represent the checksum of the bank account,\n   'checking' that there are no errors, such as 76\n * National Bank Code: A code to specifically identify a bank. such as 30006\n * Branch Code (Code Guichet or Sort Code): The branch of a bank, such as 00001\n * National Check Digits (clé RIB): 12345678901\n * Account Number: 89\n * Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN): This varies in length depending on the\n   country. In our example, it includes everything after the check digits.\n * Full IBAN: For this example IBAN, the end code would be -\n   FR7630006000011234567890189\n\nAre IBAN and SWIFT codes the same?\nNo, SWIFT codes and IBAN codes are not the same. SWIFT codes point to a\nspecific\nbank [__GHOST_URL__/how-swift-payments-work/], while IBAN codes\npoint to a particular bank account. SWIFT codes are comprised of four main\nparts, the Bank Code, the Country Code, the Location Code, and the Branch Code\nthat point out a specific international organization. IBANs are more specific,\nhelping identify the detailed account. SWIFT codes and Bank Identifier Codes\n(BIC codes) are the same things.\n\nWho uses IBAN?\nInternational financial institutions use IBAN to trade in a safe and secure way.\nIBAN is required by a handful of countries within the IBAN registry, including:\n\nBelgium, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Greenland, Hungary,\nIceland, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland,\nPortugal, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, United\nArab Emirates, and the United Kingdom.\n\nSome countries use IBAN, but it is not mandatory, such as Brazil, Costa Rica,\nIraq, Serbia, and the Virgin Islands.\n\nRouting numbers, SWIFT codes, BIC, and IBANs: What's the difference?\nAs we previously mentioned, if a sender is trying to get a specific\ninternational bank's information, they will be using a SWIFT code (which is the\nsame thing as a Bank Identifier Code or BIC code).

Here are some best practices for managing your ERP implementation to success.</p><h3 id=\"1-set-up-your-roadmap\">1. Set up your roadmap</h3><p>Just as it’s not a good idea to set out on a road trip with no idea what highways lead there, you don’t want to start your ERP implementation project without a clear roadmap, which often includes a checklist of tasks to keep the project moving. Those tasks include knowing when to start the project based on your end goal.</p><p>“Think about where you want your organization to be and work backwards from that,” says Alex Boswell, Director of Business Operations at Twilio. “For example, if you want to file for an initial public offering (IPO) within the next few years, you should run your financials through your ERP system for at least a few years, so the sooner you can start with your ERP implementation, the better, especially if you’re starting to accelerate the business.”</p><p>We spoke with a controller at a large healthcare company who agreed. “It’s much easier to implement an ERP system earlier in your company lifecycle,” she said. “I'm thankful we did it before giving our first-year financials to external auditors, so they didn't have to audit two systems.”</p><p>Once you have your end goal in mind, make sure you’ve got the right resources, and enough of them. All the important stakeholders need to be on the bus: not only do you need buy-in from executives, but the project team, consisting of project managers, technical teams, and management, must be in place and ready to go.</p><p>“Be sure you have the right internal resources aligned and committed to helping with the implementation as well as integrating the ERP system with your existing internal systems,” she said. “An accountant can help set up financial statements and the chart of accounts, but you’re going to need resources from other parts of the business that touch the ERP.”</p><h3 id=\"2-assign-roles-and-milestones\">2. Assign roles and milestones</h3><p>Before starting your ERP implementation, make sure you’ve staffed it adequately and that everyone on the project team understands their roles, the project schedule, and important milestones. You might even consider reassigning some of your ERP team’s normal job duties, so no one gets burned out.</p><p>“Your accounting team already has daily accounting tasks for the company,” says David Eckstein, CFO of Menlo Security. “Adding in the heavy burden of installing an ERP system is going to be very challenging for them.”</p><p>It’s also important to identify a dedicated team leader to “own” the process. This person, who should have top-notch project management skills, will keep the project on track, facilitate communication and collaboration between departments, and address the inevitable issues that arise. (After you go live, you may want to hire a full-time ERP admin.)</p><p>Realizing that they may not have a deep bench of ERP knowledge and expertise, many companies engage ERP vendors' professional services organizations for implementation support. NetSuite, for example, has developed its SuiteSuccess methodology, which aims to help customers not only implement its software successfully but realize continued value from it.</p><p>Other companies bring in outside third-party ERP consultants with expertise in managing ERP applications. For example, implementation consultants like <a href=\"https://www.bspny.com/\">Business Solution Partners</a>, which are part of the <a href=\"https://www.netsuite.com/portal/partners/solution-program.shtml\">NetSuite Solution Provider Program</a>, deliver everything from NetSuite licenses to implementation and support. Other ERP implementation consultants specialize in SAP or Oracle.</p><p>“A third party is going to know how to set up an ERP system much faster,” says Eckstein. “If we did it in house, it might take us two to four times as long. Someone who’s done many implementations can automate the process and help us think through that multi-dimensionality we might miss.”</p><p>Once the team is in place, it’s time to hold kick-off calls and finalize budgets, timelines with milestones, and change management plans.</p><h3 id=\"3-start-your-implementation\">3. Start your implementation</h3><p>Next is the design and development phase, when the team analyzes existing business processes and workflows, how they’ll change with the new ERP system, and which features or modules are critical. Here’s where it’s critical to keep in mind what your business needs from an ERP system.</p><p>“The number-one biggest challenge in the implementation process, by a mile, is knowing your requirements and designing processes to meet those requirements,” said the controller at a large healthcare company. “You need to think through every single button.”</p><p>At this stage, the team develops any customizations or integrations based on business functions, particularly if the new ERP system needs to connect with other systems like an inventory management, manufacturing, procurement or supply chain solution, or a business payments platform like <a href=\"https://routable.com/\">Routable</a>.</p><p>This is also the time to develop a data migration strategy. You might want to wait until the last minute to transfer transaction-based data that changes frequently, like inventory, accounts payable (AP)/accounts receivable (AR), and balances.</p><p>During this stage, train employees on how to use and leverage the new solutions, a critical aspect that can make or break the success of an ERP project.</p><p>The last step before going live is testing. You’ll want to fine-tune the system and troubleshoot any problems, because it’s better to uncover issues now, rather than after the system goes live.</p><h3 id=\"4-launch-your-erp-system\">4. Launch your ERP system</h3><p>You’ve finished configuration, data migration, and testing. The big day has arrived: Time to flip the switch and go live! Except it’s not always as easy as flipping a switch. There are <a href=\"https://www.netsuite.com/portal/resource/articles/erp/erp-implementation-strategies.shtml\">several basic implementation strategies</a>.</p><p>The first is a “big-bang” approach, in which you move all users to the new system at the same time. This strategy allows companies to start benefiting from the ERP system immediately, but it can be tricky.</p><p>“The biggest challenge of our NetSuite implementation was closing two separate sets of books at the same time,” says Bill Perilli, CFO of United Us. “But that’s part of any ERP implementation. Plan ahead, allow yourself enough time, and try to go live around a period cut-off.”</p><p>The second approach is a phased rollout, where a company deploys modules, features and tools over a period of time. This is the strategy used by at a large healthcare company, according to their controller, because the company didn’t want to launch “every bell and whistle” on the go-live date.</p><p>“We launched the financial module with our smallest subsidiary first, and then expanded it to a bigger subsidiary,” she said, “We then expanded it to inventory management, and later, to scripting and automation. We were very strategic around what we were going to go live with, what we were going to sequence, and what we were going to improve after launch.”</p><p>The third approach is parallel adoption, where an organization keeps running its legacy system in parallel with the new ERP solution for a few weeks, which offers a “safety net” in case something goes wrong. And finally, some companies use a hybrid approach of the three strategies: they might switch on core ERP modules on a given date, then phase in other modules.</p><h3 id=\"5-continue-to-groom-and-iterate\">5. Continue to groom and iterate</h3><p>Your go-live date isn’t the end of your ERP implementation story, of course. Your project team will need to monitor the system for potential issues that are bound to arise once people begin using the system for their day-to-day tasks. In addition to ongoing training (online and in person), consider providing an online knowledge base, forums, and other forms of technical support.</p><p>End-user feedback is important throughout the implementation process. The insights you gain from users will guide the implementation so it addresses real needs, and they're important after rollout as you fine tune the system.</p><h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3><p>We hope this blog series has given you a good high-level overview of the steps to successfully implementing an ERP system.

            "html": "<p>Your business is off and running and you know that you need to improve traffic flow and overall aesthetic to your website, but you also know that hiring a full-time web designer is just not in the cards. This, and many other short-term projects, are great opportunities to hire an independent contractor. These individuals specialize in specific task loads—building their own small businesses that align with their skill sets and business model—so that you can focus on your customers and growing your base. Familiarizing yourself with the solutions to common deterrents to hiring a 1099 contractor will lead to successful vendor engagement.</p><h2 id=\"what-makes-paying-1099-contractors-such-a-pain\">What makes paying 1099 contractors such a pain</h2><p>While embracing the gig economy provides much needed solutions without enrolling additional staff, the differences in how independent contractors are compensated—and the tax requirements as a result—can feel perplexing. Your business is essentially paying another business (also known as <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/intro-to-b2b-payments/\">B2B payments</a>), so the process gets a little tricky. For some, these obstacles turn into pain points that lead hiring companies away from engaging freelancers.</p><h3 id=\"manual-payments\">Manual payments</h3><p>Because 1099 contractors are not on the payroll, “paying” them is more akin to paying an electric bill than compensating a person on staff. For each contractor that you hire for individualized projects or tasks is an invoice—or multiple invoices—that needs to be reviewed, approved, and processed. These additional steps can become cumbersome and lead to poor tracking practices, leaving both the hiring company and the contractor in conflict.</p><h3 id=\"inconsistent-payment-schedules\">Inconsistent payment schedules</h3><p>Employee paychecks are on a set schedule, typically twice a month. Most companies batch process payroll for all employees, in all departments. This kind of scheduled payment is reliable and consistent—it can be anticipated and planned for. Working with various contractors, however, results in myriad invoices coming into the company in different cycles.</p><h3 id=\"manually-sending-form-1099\">Manually sending Form 1099</h3><p>Businesses that pay independent contractors more than $600 over the course of a year must provide the contractor with form 1099-NEC come tax season. Much like the W-2 that is generated for an employee, the 1099 summarizes the financial exchange between a hiring business and the contractor. But the difference is that the contractor uses that form to determine their own taxes. With a small roster of independent contractors, providing a 1099 isn’t that daunting of a task. But where a business chooses to work with multiple contractors, involving multiple invoices over the course of a year, manual creation of this documentation is riddled with potential error points.</p><h3 id=\"tax-penalties-for-errors\">Tax penalties for errors</h3><p>Mismanaging the financial relationship with an independent contractor can result in late fees and other penalties during tax season. Hiring businesses must provide a 1099-NEC to independent contractors no later than January 31st. The late fees and penalties range from $50-$500+ for each 1099 that is incorrect or late. One of the most common errors found when working with a 1099 contractor is an incorrect Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) on their W-9 form, often just a social security number (SSN) if the person is operating as a sole proprietor. Hiring companies must verify these numbers are accurate or face consequences that may include the IRS requiring backup withholding, or the withholding of a percentage of invoice payments.</p><h2 id=\"benefits-of-paying-independent-contractors-through-a-payroll-system\">Benefits of paying independent contractors through a payroll system</h2><p>The impact of Covid-19 on the global economy is tangible throughout the business landscape. In an independent study published in the fall of 2020, it was determined that 98% of those who had started freelancing during the pandemic were likely to continue freelancing in the future. Hiring businesses will need to learn how to overcome potential pain points in the relationship. One option is to treat payments made to contractors as if they were on payroll, creating a consistent system and reliable data management to minimize the seemingly sporadic nature of those AP cycles.</p><h3 id=\"quick-payments\">Quick payments</h3><p>Getting contractors paid in a timely manner benefits both parties: Contractors are reliant on payments for their own cash flow needs and your business builds report within a community of skilled workers. Having contractors enrolled in a payroll system means that vetting invoices for approval and processing exists in a structured timeline, strengthening the efficacy of AP cycles.</p><h3 id=\"accurate-payroll-records-audit-logs\">Accurate payroll records &amp; audit logs</h3><p>When contractor payments are processed manually, human error and workload can result in inconsistent and inaccurate data entry. Leaning into a payroll system for contractor payments minimizes, even eliminates, inaccuracies. Further, a digitized payroll system for contractor payments means audit logs that track dates, times, processing windows—all elements for communication should questions or concerns arise.</p><h3 id=\"auto-generate-forms-1099-nec-and-1099-misc\">Auto-generate Forms 1099-NEC and 1099-MISC</h3><p>Having a payroll system in place for paying contractors means no penalties come tax season. Form 1099-MISC and 1099-NEC can be created with accurate information and sent to contractors before deadlines lapse. This means no back and forth with the IRS, no corrections, and no fees.</p><h3 id=\"in-depth-reporting\">In-depth reporting</h3><p>Having the right contractor on the right project at the right time can be the difference in balancing a budget and achieving productive outcomes. When contractors are included in a payroll system, their data can be compared in real time against other contractors that offer similar services, setting up your procurement team with a strategic advantage.</p><h2 id=\"frequently-asked-questions-about-1099-contractor-payroll\">Frequently asked questions about 1099 contractor payroll</h2><p>Still not sure if jumping on the gig economy bandwagon is the right choice?

            "plaintext": "The original Public Enemy #1, notoriously dangerous Chicago mobster Al Capone,\nwas not incarcerated based on his acts of brutality. Capone’s trial is seen as\nthe first substantial application for what is now known as Forensic Accounting.\nFrank Wilson, a CPA with the IRS in the 1930s, used investigative techniques to\ndissect some two million documents related to the mobster’s activities. The\ninvestigation took nearly six years and revealed that the mobster was guilty of\ntax evasion. Capone was charged with 22 counts—convicted on 5—and sentenced to\n11 years in prison.\n\nWhat is forensic accounting?\nToday, businesses rely on knowledge of complex financial data to make decisions\nfor growth and development, encourage investors, and safeguard accounting\npractices while remaining in compliance with federal and international reporting\nrequirements. Internal audits of general accounting practices provide a means to\nreview and make adjustments to processes in place as needed. Audits occur\nregularly and voluntarily and should not be seen as an indication that illicit\nactivity has occurred, rather that the correct countermeasures are in place for\nfraud detection.\n\nForensic accounting, on the other hand, is a series of investigative procedures\nused to address and identify intentional acts of illegal financial activities\nand then use that information in a court of law to clear or condemn those\naccused. Forensic accountants “follow the money” by conducting research on a\ntrail of funds, analyzing gaps or misleading or misused information, compiling\nreports on the financial findings, preparing data for litigation support, and\nare prepared to testify in court if necessary.\n\nWhile there is no specific credential to be a forensic accountant beyond being a\nqualified certified public accountant (CPA), specialized degrees, a master’s\ndegree, and certifications provide the breadth of knowledge and investigative\nskills required to perform the responsibilities. These may include being a\ncertified fraud examiner (CFE) by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners\n(ACFE)—and later a Certified in Financial Forensics (CFF) credential—or a\nforensic accounting certificate from AICPA. In addition to working with public\naccounting firms or financial institutions, persons with a criminal justice\ndegree looking to work with law enforcement agency may also qualify.\n\nWhat is forensic accounting used for?\nPasswords, credit card security measures, PIN codes, multi-factor\nauthentication, one-time passcodes, and knowledge-based authentication: These\nare all measures offered today to help secure identities and sensitive financial\ninformation. However, according to an Experian report\n[https://www.experian.com/assets/decision-analytics/reports/global-fraud-report-2018.pdf]\n, while 4 out of 5 consumers trust that data protection is a top priority, 72%\nof businesses cite fraud concerns; 33% of whom reported higher levels of fraud.\n\nSituations that should send a red flag for potential fraud include recent\nturnover that aligns with inaccurate account balances, reconciliations that\nresult in unidentified differences, vendors or customers that go unpaid or do\nnot pay, poor quality products that do not meet laws and regulations, and any\ncircumstance where the documentation of finances do not correlate to actual\nnumbers.\n\nInvestigating fraud\nWhen inaccuracies are discovered, an investigation into the source is conducted.\nHopefully, discrepancies can be resolved through an internal audit. However,\nshould it be determined that something more has occurred a company may turn to\nthe forensic accounting profession to research, identify, and report on their\ndiscovery.\n\nHow forensic accounting audits work\nThe specifics of a forensic accounting audit vary depending on the nature of the\nactivity.

A\nseparate 1042-S should be filed for each type of payment made to an individual.\n\nIncome code (Box 1)\nA two-digit code that signifies what type of payment was made. For example:\ntelevision copyright royalties (11) or independent personal services (17).\n\nGross income (Box 2)\nThe total, or gross amount paid to the individual for the specific income code\nin Box 1. This is not a net income.\n\nChapter indicator (Box 3)\nIf the recipient is a foreign person, they are Chapter 3. If the recipient is a\nforeign financial institution, it is Chapter 4.\n\nExemption code (Box 3a or Box 4a) and tax rate (Box 3b or Box 4b)\nThe chapter the payments fall under determines which exemption code, if any, and\ntax rate apply. It is best practice to use the Form 1042-S instructions to\ndetermine which exemption code and tax rate to use.\n\nWithholding allowance (Box 5) and net income (Box 6)\nThis box only applies to specific income codes reported in Box 1 where special\nrules may apply. These include fellowship grants to scholars, compensation for\nindependent personal services, compensation for dependent personal services,\ncompensation for teaching, compensation during studying or training, and\nearnings as an artist or athlete. Filling in an amount in Box 6 is initiated by\nfilling in an amount in Box 5.

Use the IRS Form 1042-S instructions to determine which boxes apply.\nIn all cases, 7a must be filled in even if the amount is zero.\n\nWithholding agent identifying information (Box 12a- Box 12i)\nThese boxes are used to fill in the identifying information for the withholding\nagent filing the 1042-S. The withholding agent must provide an employer\nidentification number (EIN), Ch 3 and Ch 4 status code (both are required),\nglobal intermediary identification code (GIIN), country code and a foreign tax\nidentification number if available.\n\nRecipient identifying information (Box 13a-Box 13l)\nThese boxes are used to fill in identifying information for the recipient of\n1042-S payments including the recipient's name and address, recipient’s country\ncode, recipient status code, individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN),\nGIIN, LOB code and foreign tax identification number if available.\n\nState income tax (Box 17a-c)\nIf there has been any state taxes withheld from the payments, these are reported\nas well as the state tax number and state code.\n\nFAQs about Form 1042-S\nDo I have to report Form 1042-S?\nIf you have received Form 1042-S, the information is meant to aid you in filing\na U.S. income tax return, but it is not considered a filed tax return in and of\nitself. If both Box 7 and Box 10 are zero—referring to the U.S. Federal Tax\nWithheld and Withholding Credit, respectively—then the form is only intended to\nbe informational. For all other instances, it is reported with a U.S. Federal\ntax return.\n\nDo I need Form 1042-S if I have a Form W-2?\nPossibly. For some nonresidents who fall under tax treaties and the withholding\ncredit is less than the total gross income, a form W-2 is also provided for\nfiling income tax according to U.S. standards. Students who receive partial\nscholarships and work as a part of their financial aid may receive both forms.\nIn this example, the student would receive a Form 1042-S that reports up to the\namount covered under their home country’s treaty benefits and a Form W-2 for any\nadditional money earned from a U.S. source.\n\nIs Form 1042-S considered income?\nTypes of payments made to nonresidents from a U.S. source as defined by the Form\n1042-S instructions are considered income according to U.S. taxation\nspecifications.

The form is detailed by month and date for each\nmonth of the calendar year.

Payments fall under one of three categories: dividends,\ninterest and other income.

One of the forms you’ve likely come across is called a 1099-MISC, which covers miscellaneous income.

It's part of a larger collection of 1099 forms that are used to keep record of non-traditional income that doesn't fall into wages, salaries and tips. A Form 1099-MISC categorizes multiple types of payments beyond simple, unexpected income and is essential to many kinds of costs, from rents collected by a landlord to fishing boat proceeds. This tax form helps those receiving these unique income streams to comply with federal and state income tax laws.</p><p>In 2020, the IRS made a few major changes to Form 1099-MISC. Non-employee compensation reported in Box 7 has been removed from Form 1099-MISC. These workers, which include contractors, freelancers, sole-proprietors and self-employed individuals, must now be reported in a new form called <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1099nec.pdf\">1099-NEC</a> (Non-Employee Compensation).</p><h2 id=\"what-is-a-form-1099-misc-used-for\">What is a Form 1099-MISC used for?<br></h2><p>A 1099-MISC covers many potential income streams.

For every person that you have paid either $10 in royalties or over $600 if they fall into the other IRS requirements we noted above, you need to file a Form 1099-MISC. Note that you also have to file one of these forms for people in those categories in which you have withheld any federal income tax under backup withholding rules, no matter the amount you pay them.</p><h2 id=\"how-to-collect-form-1099-misc-from-your-vendors\">How to collect Form 1099-MISC from your vendors</h2><p>Your first step in collecting 1099-MISC forms from vendors is to give them a W-9 in order to gather tax information such as a taxpayer identification number (TIN).

Everything from sales, payroll and bill payments are all cataloged\nand organized for accessible review. Organizing finances is an integral first\nstep in a bookkeeper's work in relation to an accountant. Accuracy and\norganization are essential in all bookkeeping records to help companies better\ntrack their cash flow and spending.

Here are the major differences and similarities between\nthe two.\n\nWhat does a bookkeeper do?\nBookkeepers are in charge of tracking all of a company's financial records and\naccounts, which are kept in a record-keeping system known as a general ledger.\nBookkeepers post all costs (debits) and income (credits) of a company and\nprovide financial reports to supervisors and managers. Becoming a bookkeeper\ndoesn’t require any formal qualifications, but many bookkeepers complete a\nbachelor's degree or take exams, such as the Uniform Certified Public\nBookkeeper\nExamination\n[https://nacpb.org/bookkeeping-school/certification-exams/bookkeeping/bookkeeping-certification-exam/]\n, to secure a certification.\n\nWhat does an accountant do?\nAn account is responsible for keeping and interpreting financial records. Other\nduties in the accounting process include financial forecasting and offering\nstrategic advice. There are no mandatory requirements to become an accountant;\nhowever, it’s common to have a bachelor's degree, typically in accounting. Some\naccountants are licensed as a certified public accountant (CPA), a designation\nthat’s provided to a licensed accounting professional. A few CPA requirements\ninclude passing the CPA Exam, holding a bachelor’s degree and fulfilling\nindividual state requirements. Compared to an accountant, a CPA can perform a\nbroader range of accounting tasks, such as preparing an audited financial\nstatement\n\nHow bookkeepers and accountants are similar\nBoth a bookkeeper and an accountant play a large role in how money is managed.\nBookkeepers and accountants both need to keep thoroughly detailed and organized\nrecords, whether they're bookkeeper's ledgers or accountant's records. A company\nmay employ both for financial analysis and advice. Both types of financial\nworkers have something to offer for small and large companies.\n\nHow bookkeepers and accountants are different\nThe key distinction between a bookkeeper and an accountant is how data is\nhandled. Bookkeepers collect, track and organize a company's business and\nactivities, providing the crucial first step for an accountant to take over.\nOnce the bookkeeper prepares the data, the accountant provides detailed insights\nand financial statements for a business, which can include tax returns and\nforecasts for the company's future incomes or expenses.\n\nWhen to hire a bookkeeper vs. accountant\nBookkeeping can be an arduous process, especially for a small business owner.\nTracking, organizing and cataloging heavy sets of information is time intensive\nand often requires professional help for accuracy and comprehensiveness.\nTypically, a business would hire a bookkeeper if they have limited time, missed\nexpenses and credits, late or incorrectly filed taxes, or they notice that new\nprofits aren’t being generated.

Without understanding what to do with the wealth of\ninformation provided by a bookkeeper, that information is essentially wasted\nalong with time and money. Hiring an accountant is also a great way to make\nfiling taxes significantly easier.\n\nCan you hire both a bookkeeper and an accountant?\nThere's no reason a business couldn't hire both a bookkeeper and accountant, and\nin all probability, the presence of one will enhance the effectiveness of the\nother. In fact, if a company is undergoing rapid growth, it's common to hire\nboth once the option becomes available.

Having a blanket purchase\norder in effect with a seller that details the set price and delivery period\nwould help them streamline their orders and track them as well.\n\nContract purchase orders\nA contract purchase order is used to establish purchasing terms and conditions\nfor the long-term. For example, if a buyer wants to secure a vendor's services,\nthey could place a contract purchase order, establishing price and delivery\noptions but leaving the products to be purchased unspecified. Both parties are\nstill contractually and transactionally involved, they're just waiting for the\nneed for the product to arise.\n\nHow purchase orders work\nWe’ll continue using the car shop example to illustrate how a purchase order\nworks in general. Several different purchase orders can go through all or some\nof the processes listed below, and the steps may differ depending on the\nbusiness.\n\n1. Buyer decides to order items from the seller\nStep one is relatively straightforward: It’s a simple request for goods or\nservices. The car shop orders several tires for a model that comes to them\noften.\n\n2. Buyer drafts purchase order and sends to seller for approval\nKnowing exactly what they need and how much, the buyer will create a purchase\norder along with details on when they need the item and what shipping costs\nmight be incurred, then they send it to the seller. At this stage, our car shop\nwould contact a local tire yard and put in a PO for 16 tires by Thursday,\noffering to pay the freight for the order.\n\n3. Seller reviews purchase order and confirms if they can fulfill the request.\nThe seller looks to their available inventory and resources to confirm they can\nmeet all the order requirements. If everything is good in that regard, they can\nproceed. Creating a PO allows them to avoid an order they'd be otherwise unable\nto fulfill. In the car shop example, the tire yard confirms they have the right\nnumber of tires available and can prepare them for shipping to be delivered by\nThursday.\n\n4. Purchase order approval\nWith both parties in agreement over the purchase order details, this step is\nsimply both of them confirming and moving forward with the order. For our car\nshop, that means they offer a final confirmation with the tire yard who has\nstated they can meet the demand. Everything gets a green light, and things get\nmoving.\n\n5. Product or service is fulfilled\nIn the next phase, the order is completed. All products are shipped to their\ndestination in accordance with the agreed upon terms. For our car shop, a\nsuccessful fulfillment means they receive their 16 tires by Thursday.\n\n6. The invoice is paid\nThe seller’s generated invoice, created via whichever PO tracking software is in\nplace, would be sent promptly to the buyer in this final phase, at which point\nthe buyer simply pays the regular price of the goods they purchased. At this\nstep, the car shop pays the money they owe for the 16 tires and the costs to\nship them.\n\nThe difference between purchase orders and invoices\nThe biggest difference between a purchase order and an invoice is function.\nPurchase orders are created to track and guide the purchasing process. Invoices,\nby contrast, are official payment requests made by vendors once the original\norder has been filled. For a more simplified explanation, think of it like this:\nA purchase order states the details of an order and is legally binding. An\ninvoice, on the other hand, requests payment. Purchase orders and invoices can\nbe used together as part of a two- or three-way match\n[https://blog.routable.com/3-way-matching/] process to complete a payment.\n\nAutomate your purchase order processing with Routable\nManual purchase order processing is time consuming and increases the likelihood\nof errors. If you're interested in improving your current PO process, automation\nis the best way to do that. Comprehensive automation software like Routable can\nhelp your team cut down on manual data entry to process and track POs more\nefficiently and accurately. Routable connects to the accounting software you\nlove (Xero [https://routable.com/integrations/xero], QuickBooks\n[https://routable.com/integrations/quickbooks-online], NetSuite\n[https://routable.com/integrations/netsuite] and Sage Intacct\n[https://routable.com/integrations/sage-intacct]) using real-time two way sync\nfor clear payment records and easy reconciliation. And features such as\nautomatic audit trail tracking, streamlined approvals with notifications and \nmass payments with a simple CSV upload\n[https://blog.routable.com/mass-payments-bulk-csv-upload/] can help you process\nthousands of payments no matter how much your company grows.",

            "plaintext": "Routable has grown significantly during my time here: two funding rounds (\nSeries\nA [__GHOST_URL__/announcing-12m-in-series-a-funding/] and Series B\n[https://blog.routable.com/series-b-announcement/]), two new accounting\nintegrations (Oracle NetSuite [https://routable.com/integrations/netsuite/] and \nSage Intacct [__GHOST_URL__/custom-dimensions-for-sage-intacct/])\nand countless new features. Our team has exploded in size from when I first\njoined, starting with only five engineers to now over 50. I’ve learned so much\nalong the way, and in this post, I’d love to share five of my main takeaways\nfrom the experience so far.\n\n1. Establish your values and norms early—and document them\nEvery company has values and norms, but have you written them down? Routable has\n[https://routable.com/about].\n\nIn the beginning stages, founders and early employees establish the culture of\ntheir organization in explicit and implicit ways. A few examples include how you\ngive praise, take time off, deal with conflict and give feedback. As growth\noccurs, culture can shift organically—and not in ways you sometimes expect or\nwant. Writing down your values helps new employees understand what’s expected of\nthem, how their success will be measured and how to navigate the culture of the\ncompany.\n\nIn my former life, I was a special education teacher. I carry a lot of that\nexperience with me as an engineer and manager. I believe you shouldn’t expect\nsomeone to know something unless they’ve been taught. We all remember that\nteacher who’d put questions on the test that wasn’t on the study guide. Don’t be\nthat teacher.\n\nAt Routable, we set up new employees for success by having a solid onboarding\naligned with our values. We use tools like Rippling [https://www.rippling.com/] \nand Lattice [https://lattice.com/] to automate onboarding tasks and set up\nrecurring one-on-ones, allowing us to start building authentic relationships\nthat allow us to engage with empathy during every interaction. Everyone gets an\nintroduction to the product with WorkRamp [https://www.workramp.com/] courses\nand hands-on experience with Routable using TestRail\n[https://www.gurock.com/testrail/] so that they’re able to own their role and\nbuild with purpose. Our norms are documented all over Notion\n[https://www.notion.so/] in the form of repeatable processes.\n\n2. Rethink team organization\nThat same growth that necessitates clear values and norms necessitates a\ndifferent organizational structure. When Routable started, we had two groups of\nengineers: frontend and backend. This worked because each group had only about\nfive engineers. Now, we’re organized into Pods.\n\nA Pod is a team that consists of about five engineers along with a product\nmanager, designer and a quality engineer. At Routable, we have nine Pods. I’m\npart of the Partner Management Pod where we build an industry-leading vendor\nexperience and give our Routable clients awesome tools to manage their business\nrelationships. \n\nPods can also own and build a business domain. They can change, grow and split\nas the organizational needs dictate.While there is no one-size-fits-all solution\nthat works across all companies, there is some research to support the basic\nconcept of a Pod-like structure. Enter one of the biggest organizations in the\nworld: the U.S. Federal Government.\n\nAs a search and rescue volunteer in Southern Oregon, I use the Department of\nHomeland Security’s National Incident Management Structure\n[https://www.nh.gov/safety/divisions/hsem/documents/NIMSQA1305.pdf] (NIMS for\nshort). NIMS supports interoperability and flexibility. \n\nThat sounds like a growing company to me. Interoperability translates to\ncommunication and eliminating information silos. Flexibility means that the\nsystem can grow, shrink, shift, and change to meet the demands of any problem.\nMy favorite NIMS principle is manageable span of control\n[https://emilms.fema.gov/is_0100c/groups/28.html]: One boss should have about\nfive direct reports. Much more and you can’t support everyone or have a general\noverview of team effectiveness. Any less and you’re under-utilizing resources.\n\n3. Keep code quality up with automation\nOne of our hardest tasks has been balancing our code quality standards with the\nneed to build quickly. Routable Pods each developed a subset of norms about what\nis acceptable code quality while staying true to the overall “sweat the small\nstuff” engineering culture.\n\nOur venerable CTO Tom Harel [https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-harel-74668864/]has\nalways said, “If it’s not linted, we shouldn’t care.” I’ll add my own feelings:\nLet computers do the dumb stuff.\n\nOn most of our projects, we have a robust set of linting rules that automates\ncode formatting and the other “small stuff” that keeps a codebase clean.We also\nhave a robust set of unit and end-to-end tests we run using continuous\nintegration, on each pull request.

At Routable, we’re\nconstantly thinking about the next iteration, because doing things right the\nfirst time almost always saves money, capacity, headaches and sanity in the long\nrun.

Slowing down and building for the future\nisn’t a new concept, but it can feel aspirational when you’re in “startup mode.”\n\nOne thing we’re trying to do as we look to the next iteration is to consider how\nto break our application into smaller, more atomic pieces. Not quite\nmicroservices but a service-oriented architecture.\n\nOur use of Django on the backend lends itself to this type of architecture\nthrough sub-apps which could theoretically be pulled out and owned by a single\nPod. At this point, we’re not quite big enough for that to make sense; having to\nmake code changes across tons of different repositories would slow product\ndevelopment to a crawl.

We’ve started adopting TypeScript for\nself-documenting code; the static typing also provides more safety at scale to\nJavaScript. We need to reduce our state management boilerplate and find a better\nway of making use of the JSON:API structure to cache assets.\n\n5. The Three Ps: Process, Process, Process\nAs we think ahead to the future of engineering at Routable, we’ve got these huge\nscalability goals. But to meet that challenge, our processes have to scale as\nwell.\n\nTake a look at how our product development has changed over the years. \n\nIn our early days: \n\n * The CEO or CTO presented an idea based on customer interviews.\n * The designer (yes, the one designer) would translate those ideas into a\n   solution.\n * Frontend engineers would code those designs to life.\n * Backend engineers built the data models to support the functionality.\n * At some point, frontend engineers and backend engineers would either wire\n   together the pieces or not—everyone was working on one feature, so problems\n   would get resolved pretty quickly.\n\nThis process doesn’t work as you get bigger.\n\nIn our more mature product development life cycle, here’s what we do now:\n\n * Our executive team works together with product and engineering to set OKRs\n   and KPIs to move the company forward.\n * Product managers discover features or improvements aligned with those goals\n   and interview customers to validate their ideas.\n * Designers turn these ideas into visible assets (and magic, lots of magic).\n   Pod tech leads evaluate the product specifications and designs to create a\n   valid architectural framework for the solution, which they bounce off of code\n   architects.\n * Tech leads also support sprint development through ticket writing and guiding\n   ticket refinement.\n * The engineering managers help plan sprint capacity and timelines, all while\n   the individual engineers are crunching away on their code.\n\nPhew. That’s actually all of my previous four lessons I learned tied up in one\nmeaty process. This development cycle is documented as a norm, includes a lot of\nteam players, delegates responsibility so individual engineers can focus on code\nquality, and thinks ahead to the future by including architectural review.\n\nIn summary…\nThe best time to plant a fruit tree is 20 years ago. The second best time is\nnow.\n\n * We started with documenting our values and norms. We believe in teaching our\n   folks what’s expected of them through great onboarding and mentorship.\n * As we grew, we considered how our team structure supports team members to\n   live those values and follow those norms.

We’ve\nbuilt CSV upload to be used on a repeated basis without any concerns for data\nintegrity, validation or other problems that could easily occur during this\nprocess.\n\nCSV upload helps you and your team:\n\n * Save hours of work processing large volumes of payments\n * Scale your process without the need for full API integration\n * Reduce headaches from manually inputting data and checking for accuracy\n   yourself\n\nHere’s how Routable makes this possible.\n\n1. Upload your CSV\nIf you’re inputting hundreds or thousands of payables a week manually or via a\nspreadsheet, CSV upload will reduce hours of your current workflow by\nstreamlining the whole process. Uploading a CSV to Routable is easy and\nlightning fast. After you’ve customized and downloaded your NetSuite CSV\ntemplate for payables\n[https://docs.routable.com/en/articles/5339817-setting-up-your-csv-template-for-sending-bulk-payables]\n, you can get started in the Routable dashboard. Click New > Bulk upload at the\ntop of the left navigation on your dashboard to upload your CSV file.\n\n2. Scale your process\nWith a quick check, Routable validates your entire CSV for any missing fields,\nincorrect amounts and most major errors you might encounter. Gone are the days\nof you or your team checking through every field under a microscope. If there\nare any issues, we’ll display a list of them on the page or you can click the\nbutton “download error report” to get a file with all the errors identified.\n\nWe also map all your fields to NetSuite for you so you’re not doing double the\nwork. If you do need to add any approvers, we’ll prompt you to add them toward\nthe end.\n\n3. Save yourself the headache\nAfter your CSV has passed Routable’s validation check you can see a Summary of\nall payments that will be created with your upload. As long as everything looks\ngood, congratulations🎉  you just successfully uploaded your first of many\nNetSuite CSVs to Routable!\n\nYour team will appreciate your good work and the hours of time you’ve saved them\nfrom manual data entry.

A thoughtful and\ncarefully constructed plan will provide a clear view of your business’s\nfinancial health and identify where improvements can be made for growth. Getting\nstarted, however, can seem like a Herculean task when your business is just\ngetting started or if your team is small.\n\nTo make the process a little easier, we’re going to highlight five best\npractices to follow while you’re planning, and this blog post will get you\nstarted with the first one: finding your three financial support systems.\n\n 1. Tax support\n 2. Strategic advisory \n 3. Accounting operations \n\nEach of these core functions requires unique and different skill sets. Many\nbusinesses fall into the trap of a “one size fits all” approach, but the\nchallenge with this is that no company can optimally resource all three of these\nfunctions without forfeiting quality in one or more areas.\n\nTax support\nEvery business is required to file taxes. The traditional CPA firm is built for\nthis specific need. Their partners and even junior partners focus on tax, tax\nlaw and tax strategy as a core competency. These same skills can translate well\nto audit work as well. The volume of information needed to understand tax law\nand strategy is never ending.\n\nYour tax provider should focus on employee tax needs and compliance, sales tax\nfilings and strategy, and most importantly annual tax filings. A good tax\nadvisor will also include guidance around tax benefits that your business can\ntake advantage of throughout the year and into the future to support growth.\n\nTax related work is the greatest revenue generator for CPA firms. That is why\nthey focus their teams and top resources on their tax practice and not on areas\nlike financial modeling or accounting operations (i.e., bookkeeping). In many\ncases the same CPA firm that is charging you monthly to do your bookkeeping is\nalso going to charge you to clean up the financials so you can file your taxes.\nThe resources and skill sets are misaligned for this type of work.\n\nEven within tax, there are subsets of groups with specific focus areas that can\nhelp to improve your bottom line.

This is one obvious example of why specializing and finding\nthe right partners is so critical to business success.\n\nStrategic advisory\nThe role of strategic advisor normally falls to the fractional CFO or\ncontroller. As your business grows there is a great deal of forward-looking\nmodeling and analysis needed to create things like your budget, revenue\nforecast, headcount planning, and in some cases capacity planning or job\ncosting. Each of these requires a skill set unique to finance experts with\nexperience creating and maintaining these models. Making sure that you find a\nCFO or controller who has actual experience working inside companies is\nimportant too.\n\nOne other area that will require constant evaluation as your business grows is\nthat of price analysis and planning. Understanding how you should price your\ngoods or services is a constant evolution. Ensuring you are achieving the right\nmargins to support growth and scale is paramount to ongoing success.\n\nFinancial analysis spans across your business. These models can help identify\nwhere you are over-investing or under-investing in your business.

In fact, you can’t do your taxes or forecast ahead without good\nfinancial data from accounting operations. \n\nAccounting operations are the behind-the-scenes operations that keep everything\nin your business running. They are the financial language of your business.\n\nGreat bookkeepers understand the difference between bookkeeping for tax purposes\nand streamlined accounting operations that make it easier to run a business and\nmake good financial decisions. It’s either easy to pay your bills, pay your\npeople and get paid or it’s harder and takes longer than it should.\n\nOnce accounting operations are streamlined, then comes the strategic bookkeeping\nelement. You either bookkeep for taxes or to understand the business on a\nmonth-to-month basis. The greatest difference between the two can be found in\nyour chart of accounts. The chart of accounts essentially creates “folders” for\nyou to book certain types of transactions. For example you could have a “Catch\nAll” account that is called Marketing.

Look at finance in manageable parts </h3><p>The functions of the finance team are unique, and trying to fit all of these functions into a one-size-fits-all box will lead to unnecessary workarounds.

He recently shared why he chose to come to Routable, his\nplans for the finance team and how he developed his leadership style.\n\nQ: Can you share more about your background and what you were doing before\ncoming to Routable?\nA: I have spent nearly a decade in high-growth, product-focused organizations in\nfintech and SaaS companies. I have been part of or led finance teams in\nFinancial Planning and Analysis (FP&A), Strategic Finance, Treasury, Product\nFinance and Corporate Finance at PayPal. Immediately before coming to Routable,\nI led Revenue FP&A and Strategic Finance at Dropbox.\n\nPrior to moving to the tech sector, I spent over a decade between investment\nbanking at Citibank in New York and consumer banking in Asia, Europe and Middle\nEast, working in finance, analytics and product management.\n\nI am educated as an engineer and product manager. I have a bachelor in\ntechnology from IIT (India), a post graduate from IIM (India) and an MBA from\nYale School of Management.\n\nQ: Why did you decide to come to Routable?\nA: I am excited about the intersection of finance and technology (aptly, named\nfintech), and I strongly believe finance can help accelerate and enhance product\ndevelopment for truly remarkable change and impact lives beyond the scope of the\nproduct.\n\nI have seen firsthand how fintech can help increase financial flexibility for\nmillions of people around the world and how innovation can help small and\nmedium-sized businesses grow, thrive and react to a rapidly changing business\nenvironment. B2B currently is at the same early stage of innovation that B2C was\nin 2014 and 2015 (B2B innovation typically lags behind B2C by six to eight\nyears).\n\nWhen I met Omri and the exec team, I was not actively looking for a change. But\nafter talking to him, getting a demo of the product and understanding their view\nand focus on product and customer needs, I knew this organization would build a\ntruly innovative product that can impact small and large businesses by making\ntheir financial processes more efficient and flexible. I wanted to be part of\nthis journey. It’s been four months since I joined, and I am more excited about\nour future than I ever was.\n\nQ: Routable is making strides in the fintech space. What does it mean to be a\npart of this team?\nA: Finance is an inherent part of any business. And a critical (and often most\ninefficient) part of the finance process is paying vendors and partners and\nreconciling that payment with accounting systems.\n\nI like to give an example of where the need for Routable arises. Imagine you are\ntraining for a marathon. You start working out, running, hitting your stride and\nstart clocking one to two miles. But at a certain level you plateau. No matter\nhow much you try, you are not able to break through. It’s only when you realize\nthat you are wearing the wrong shoes and switch to the right ones that you’re\nable to reach your next milestone. Automating account payables is akin to\ngetting the right financial processes, the right foundation to support your\ngrowth. Most businesses ignore this aspect of the foundation and then try to\nsolve it by increasing their manual processes, thereby making their financial\nfoundation even more cumbersome and complex.\n\nRoutable is uniquely positioned for that need. I love client calls, and it makes\nmy day when a client appreciates the product and our team. I feel we are truly\nmaking a difference, and I am honored to be part of the team doing that.\n\nQ: What are a few goals you’re prioritizing for the Finance department this\nyear?\nA: Our first goal is investing in product without compromising our focus on\nexecution. A great product is the foundation of a great business. As Finance, we\nengage regularly with our department heads to ensure we are investing according\nto the changing needs of our business and the overall economic environment.\n\nNext, data is the core of our business. We are in the process of building an\nanalytics team that is structured and equipped for the next 10X growth in our\ncustomer base.\n\nWe also plan to focus on a consistent analysis of risk. We continue to enhance\nour risk controls as we scale monthly.\n\nLast but not the least, you really can’t do all the above without a robust\nfinance team!\n\nQ: How do you plan to support Routable’s rapid growth?\nA: Growing at the speed that we are now and that we hope to in the future has\nits own challenges. Being a fintech product-focused company, Finance supports\nnot only the organization but also engages in product discussions and other\nfacets of the business. I love the fact that we are investing our resources in\ncreating great products, and I enjoy the decisions we need to make to optimize\nour spend and growth. There is no dearth of opportunities, and we need to\ncontinue to focus and execute on our priorities and multi-year plans.\n\nQ: The VP of Finance has to collaborate across the organization. How do you like\nto collaborate with different departments?\nA: It is quite interesting how Routable’s departments are so engaged with each\nother. The exec team has a smooth flow of information and an appreciation of the\ncommon mission that we are all striving to achieve. We are a remote company so\nwe have executive and departmental check-in meetings and a healthy dose of Zoom\ncalls and asynchronous collaboration. And talking to people to understand their\nneeds is the best way to understand the pulse of the business.\n\nCandidly, based on my last two decades of work, this is the most engaged,\ncollaborative and supportive culture I have seen. That is the secret sauce that\nI feel will make us successful. (I guess, it’s not a secret any more!)\n\nQ: What are some leadership lessons you’ve learned in your career?\nA: Intellectual Curiosity: I have come to appreciate the importance of\nintellectual curiosity in business (and generally in life!). I spend dedicated\ntime every week just going through business metrics and data on our customers,\ntrends and analytics, or going beyond the financial impact of a product or\nfeature (e.g., fund flow, UX, design—things not related to finance). Getting to\nunderstand the “pulse” of the business is important for any finance\nprofessional.\n\nThe Power of Listening is critical for any professional. In face-to-face\nmeetings, I usually switch off my phone or keep it upside down. It gives an\nindication to the meeting participants that I am dedicated and focused on the\ntask at hand.\n\nBut now we are remote. With Zoom calls, Slack messages and a consistent barrage\nof emails, I found I was getting distracted. So I now block my notifications in\nevery call, and I leave 10 min between meetings to check all messages or send\nemails. I also have dedicated “no meeting times” every day.\n\nIt is not only important to listen to others, but also to yourself. Developing\nthat intuitive sense of a business will help avoid pitfalls and open new\nopportunities. But that happens when you remove distractions, which comes to my\nnext principle.\n\nFocus: I love this quote: “It is not daily increase but daily decrease, hack\naway the unessential. The closer to the source, the less wastage there is.”\n\nIn business, as in life, a focus on key variables or drivers will bring you far\nahead than a mix of busy, probably unnecessary “work.” I remember a very short\nstory that brings forth this point:\n\nImagine you want to fill a glass with a mix of sand and rocks. If you fill a\nglass with sand, you won’t have space to fit in the rocks. If you fill in the\nrocks, the sand will find its way in. The rocks are those critical variables\nthat drive the business. (Separate point: In life, the rocks can be key drivers\nof happiness, personal development or growth. If you focus on those rocks, you\nwill always find the time, sooner or later, to catch up on the next episode of\nSquid Game!).\n\nQ: What do you like to do for fun outside of work?\nA: Apart from reading (I read a lot!), I love nature and I love to hike. I am\nblessed to be in the Bay Area where there are numerous trails and hikes. I am\nalso an amateur writer and just started taking courses to improve my creative\nwriting. Trying to check an item off the bucket list!\n\nBeing an ex-banker, I am definitely obsessed with Wall Street and the overall\neconomic environment. The current dynamic geo-political and economic environment\npresents new opportunities to entertain. Who needs the story twists of Game of\nThrones when there are such wild swings in real life economic markets!\n\nQ: What three adjectives would you use to describe yourself?\nA: Persistent, open-minded, versatile\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCome join the Routable team!

            "plaintext": "Justin Myers is one of Routable’s most legendary characters.\n\nPart code wiz, part Ukulele strumming star, Justin is a builder and creator at\nheart. As a teenager, he participated in coding camps and spent afternoons in\nself-guided learning library sessions hacking on Commodore 64, IBM 8086 and\nApple 2 machines. Programming quickly became a means of self expression and\nexploration. After high school and some time on active duty with the army,\nJustin got a temp job at Microsoft. There, his knack for software blossomed,\nlaunching his career.\n\nJustin joined Routable in 2018 as our very first engineer. Since then he’s\nwritten a colossal amount of our backend code in use today and has helped\ndevelop many of our internal processes and best practices.\n\nAmong the engineering, product and support teams, Justin is a wizard. He’s able\nto quickly help with any given problem of any size while juggling platefuls of\ntasks. He knows the intricacies of all our complex ledger integrations from Xero\nto QBO, NetSuite and Sage, and he can shepherd the architecture of our largest\nbuilds. He also often stands at the frontline to support clients joining\nRoutable.\n\nJustin is truly a champion of every one of Routable’s values\n[https://routable.com/about], and his peers genuinely believe he possesses\nsupernatural powers:\n\nWe wanted to learn a little more about Justin and his experience working at\nRoutable, so we caught up with him for a quick Q+A.\n\nWhat makes Routable different?\nWhat really makes Routable different is the people and the culture. Starting at\nthe top with Omri and Tom and their passion for building a great product and not\nskipping on things like customer support where other companies do.\n\nYou can see it in our Slack channels, in how inclusive we are and how much we\ncare about our people. If you’re sick, go take the time off. Like, literally in\nthe middle of a meeting it’ll be like, “Go, go take care of yourself.\" You can\ncome back or someone else can pick up your work or you can finish it when you’re\nfeeling better. \n\nFinding a place to work like this is truly rare. So many places will run people\nragged and push people really hard, and as we continue to scale we’re making\nsure to instill a healthy environment from the top down.\n\nWhat advice do you have for people joining Routable?\nCommunication is always going to be the best advice I can give someone. Let\npeople know where you are, where you are struggling and things like that.\n\nThe second piece of advice is to ask for help. Don’t let yourself struggle\nforever when someone might have a quick answer. They might already have a method\nof doing the exact thing you’re struggling with.\n\nAdvice that’s more specific to us [developers]: Understand the complexity of\nwhat we’re building. One of the things I see developers struggling with is\nthey’ll make a change and not realize the implications of that change. Take the\ntime to really dig deep to understand what could happen when making changes.\n\nWhat’s an interesting problem you’ve worked on at Routable?\nThe first is what we would call \"Item creation\" or \"Payable/Receivable\ncreation.\" It’s not as straightforward as other objects we create. Rather, we\nhave this basic thing that encompasses a payable or receivable, but it can be\nmade 20 ways from Sunday. So, it’s interesting building stuff that works no\nmatter what and at the same time isn’t too complicated to read.\n\nAnother, is our connection to the ledgers, building something that connects\nsimple accounting softwares and more advanced ERPs like Netsuite\n[https://routable.com/integrations/netsuite/] and Sage Intacct\n[https://routable.com/integrations/sage-intacct] in a standardized way. It’s\ninteresting building something that can integrate with different accounting\nsoftware and support all the custom fields and custom settings\n[https://blog.routable.com/custom-dimensions-for-sage-intacct/] that those\nledgers have.\n\nJustin, what’s your passion in and outside of work?\nBeing with family and being out with nature are the two things I enjoy the most\noutside of work.\n\nAs far as at work, I love mentoring, I love teaching where I’m there to help\nsupport other developers and help them get to that next level of critical\nthinking and how to make awesome software. I think one can do awesome things\nnext to a keyboard whether that’s writing code to move money or sharing pictures\nor AI or whatever. There can be a lot of glory in any type of program one\ndecides to write.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRoutable encourages folks take care of themselves by taking time off as needed.\nJustin will be taking a sabbatical soon and setting out on an adventure with his\nfamily to explore each of the national parks throughout the country. We wish him\nthe best on his well-earned break and thank him for allowing us to put him in\nthe Developer Spotlight.\n\nInterested in joining our engineering team?

            "plaintext": "Two of the most common questions new Routable customers ask are “what is KYC\nverification?” and “what is KYB?” \n\nKYC stands for “know your customer” while KYB stands for “know your business.”\nThe two are closely related and imply more than knowing your customers and\nclients on a personal level. They’re required by law.\n[https://www.occ.treas.gov/topics/supervision-and-examination/bsa/bsa-related-regulations/index-bsa-and-related-regulations.html]\n\nKYB and KYC verification are longstanding regulatory requirements that banking\nand financial institutions must abide by or risk facing penalties. As Routable\nfalls under the umbrella of a financial service, we require both KYB and KYC\nverification for all customers. This blog post breaks down both processes, why\nthey’re important for every Routable customer and how exactly they work.\n\nWhat KYC means\nKYC means “know your customer” though sometimes the term is also a shorthand for\n“know your client.” KYC verification is the essential process of checking and\nconfirming that customers are who they say they are.\n\nPer KYC guidelines, banks and financial institutions are required to understand\ntheir customers’ financial dealings. A bank, for example, could be held liable\nfor opening an account used by a criminal running a money laundering scheme. KYC\nrequirements were put in place as a precaution with good intentions at their\ncore. By following mandatory KYC guidelines, you’re doing your part in\nprotecting everyone involved.\n\nWhat is KYC in banking?\nIf you’ve opened a bank account, you’ve likely gone through KYC verification.\nThe SEC requires [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/knowyourclient.asp]\ncustomers to provide certain information when doing so, such as employment\nstatus, income and date of birth. Early KYC regulations first emerged in 1970 to\nhelp stem money laundering. The Banking Secrecy Act\n[https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/bank-secrecy-act] \nwas passed by Congress to require businesses to maintain records of customer\ntransactions and report cash payments that exceed $10,000, for example. As more\nbusinesses operate online, banks have implemented more KYC regulations to help\nreduce crime and prevent fraud. Specifically, the U.S. Financial Crimes\nEnforcement Network (often referred to as FinCEN) added rules that banks must\nadhere to when verifying a customer’s identity.\n\nOver time, regulations have expanded and have only become stricter so financial\ninstitutions are subject to higher and higher standards. The result is that a\nwide variety of online businesses, platforms and companies also must adhere to\nthese standards because they complete transactions with financial institutions.\nThe consequences are real for not complying: In 2020, fines totaled $10.6\nbillion, a 27% increase from 2019 [https://www.fenergo.com/fines-report-2020/].\n\nWho is required to have KYC?\nToday, any bank, fintech (like Routable) and financial institution must comply\nwith KYC regulations. In the digital age where business is conducted online\nrather than face-to-face, it’s common to do business with people we’ve never met\nbefore. That’s why now more companies than ever need to have their official\ndocumentation checked to validate their identity when doing business with these\ninstitutions.\n\nFor starters, it’s important to verify basic facts about customers, including\ntheir legal name, age and address. Sometimes KYC verification requires more\nin-depth documentation, too. (We explain what documents are required in the\nsections below.)  KYC verification is a standard requirement for\nbusiness-related payments and ultimately helps Routable’s customers power mass\npayouts at a greater scale safely and securely.\n\nThe three components of KYC\nThere are three key components of KYC verification: Customer Identification\nProgram (CIP), Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and Continuous monitoring. Let’s\nbreak down what each of these mean, and why it’s important that organizations\nlike Routable carry them out.\n\n * Customer Identification Program (CIP): This means confirming a person is who\n   they claim to be. A customer may need to submit a valid driver’s license or\n   passport, for example. A business may need to provide articles of\n   incorporation or a valid business license, among other documents. Financial\n   statements may also need to be verified.\n * Customer Due Diligence (CDD): Banks and financial institutions are required\n   to analyze the risk of a customer’s account. In other words, evaluate how\n   likely someone is to launder money or commit fraud among other crimes. They\n   may be required to monitor customers more frequently if they have a higher\n   risk profile. For example, high-net-worth customers tend to have a higher\n   risk profile and may require more frequent monitoring.\n * Continuous monitoring: Rather than checking clients during onboarding alone,\n   financial institutions are responsible for reporting suspicious activity over\n   time. This helps protect everyone over the long haul.\n\nAt Routable, how is KYC verification done?\nIt’s important to balance accurate verification and meet the industry’s\ncompliance standards without sacrificing efficiency. That’s why Routable\nrequires clients to complete a straightforward KYC verification process. This is\na standard procedure done through the Routable platform that’s meant to\nstreamline the process while also protecting everyone involved. Customers upload\nbasic documentation to validate simple facts about their business.\n\nWhat is KYB?\nKYB (or know your business) is an extension of KYC regulations. KYB requires\nfintechs to check the \"identity\" of a business and ensure they're not laundering\nmoney. Different countries have different KYB laws and regulations, too.\n\nAt Routable, what are KYC/KYB requirements and how do they work?\nAt Routable, we verify both KYC/KYB at the same time. Clients must provide proof\nof basic information about themselves to verify both their identity and their\nbusiness. For example, a customer can provide a driver’s license or other ID\ncard for KYC verification. For KYB, they may upload documents to confirm their\nregistered business address or financial details.\n\nFollow these tips when uploading any KYC/KYB verification documents to the\nRoutable platform.\n\nThe KYC/KYB verification process at Routable is straightforward:\n\n 1. Customers create an account.\n 2. They add verification documents.\n 3. Once verified, customers can start sending payments and invoices.\n\nCustomers provide their legal business name, business type, EIN, business\ncategory and registered business address. To ensure verification is approved\nwithout delay, the legal business name input on Routable must exactly match the\nofficial business name. If operating under a DBA (doing business as), just use\nthe original name used to register the business. It’s important to input\nwhatever name is legally on file with the IRS.\n\nTo complete KYC/KYB verification, Routable requires customers to upload an \nIRS-issued EIN letter. If you don’t know where to find the letter or lost it, \nthis page offers guidance on what to do\n[https://docs.routable.com/en/articles/2213383-business-verification-documents].\n\nCustomers also have the option to instead upload:\n\n * Filed and stamped Articles of Organization or Incorporation\n * Sales/Use Tax License\n * Business License\n * Certificate of Good Standing\n\nAdditionally, customers need to submit information for one representative. This\ncan be anyone at your company who is authorized to deal on behalf of the\nbusiness, typically the controller. The representative must: \n\n 1. Provide their phone number and current address\n 2. Upload a government-issued ID and ID number\n\nFor the latter, either a driver’s license or passport along with a social\nsecurity number (SSN) or passport number typically suffices. This information is\nrequired to comply with U.S. Federal customer due diligence rules.\n\nAnother tip to expedite the process is to make sure to take a clear photo of the\nID, showing all four edges with no glare. It may take a few tries to snap a\nquality photo that’s not blurry or obscured by the flash’s glare but it’s worth\nit to ensure speedy approval. \n\nThis example shows how to properly upload a document to the Routable platform\nfor speedy KYC/KYB verification.How long does KYC/KYB verification take?\nIt typically takes 48 hours (or less) for an account to be verified by Routable.\nOur technology plus a real human from our team check each uploaded document.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKYB and KYC verification are standard practices today. Routable helps ensure\nverification is as straightforward as possible so customers can start making\npayments fast. We believe maintaining higher KYC/KYB standards than our\ncompetitors is worthwhile because your safety is our priority. If you need any\nhelp during the process, review the KYC/KYB instructions available in your\nRoutable dashboard or reach out to sales@routable.com with questions.",

Here’s how cross-border payments work.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/06/Path.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Cross-border payment process flow\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/06/Path.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/06/Path.png 800w\"></figure><h3 id=\"step-1-identify\">Step 1: Identify</h3><p>Just like a domestic payment, accounts payable (AP) tracks incoming invoices and identifies that a payment is coming due for an overseas vendor. Tax documentation should be collected before a vendor is deemed payable. Having these documents on hand before the first invoice arrives helps make the following steps easier since they include identifying information you need to complete payments.</p><p><strong>Related reading</strong>: Tax documents <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/understanding-form-w-8ben-e/\">W-8BEN-E Form</a> and <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/understanding-form-1042-s/\">Form 1042-S</a></p><h3 id=\"step-2-route\">Step 2: Route</h3><p>Once approvals for the payment are met, the payment can continue. You’ll need important identifying information from your vendor when you’re routing an international payment. If you’re sending a check or prepaid card, your vendor’s name and address will suffice. However, if you’re making a wire transfer or international ACH, you need a bank account number and/or an international routing number. Have your vendor’s International Bank Account Number (IBAN) handy as well.</p><p><strong>Suggested reading</strong>: <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/what-is-iban/\">What’s an IBAN?</a></p><h3 id=\"step-3-approve-or-decline\">Step 3: Approve or decline</h3><p>Your financial institution takes over processing the payment transfer. If there’s an error with your bank communicating to a foreign financial institution, the payment will be stopped or declined. A number of reasons affect approval for international payments, including incorrect banking information. There may also be more than just two financial institutions involved in the transfer depending on where your vendor is located, which can further slow the process.</p><h3 id=\"step-4-settle\">Step 4: Settle</h3><p>If all goes well, your payment will be approved. At this time, a foreign financial institution takes over and settles the final transfer of payment to your vendor. The amount of time that it takes for a payment to settle depends on the regulations in place by the local bank. Fees may be assessed at this stage of the process depending on currency conversion and the payment method used.</p><h3 id=\"step-5-track\">Step 5: Track</h3><p>Just like a domestic payment, once a cross-border payment has been made and processed, your finance team will need to track whether the payment has been approved and settled. Unfortunately, two-way communication between payer and payee via their financial institutions is not always available. The payer may be informed that a payment is declined while the payee isn’t notified. If there are delays or hidden fees, both finance teams may spend time retracing the steps of the process to resolve the issue.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2 id= \"challenges of cross-border payments\"> Challenges of cross-border payments</h2><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>While it’s exciting to work with international teams, making payments across borders brings about its own set of challenges. Here are the top four as identified by the <a href=\"https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P131021-2.pdf\">Financial Stability Board (FSB)</a>.</p><h3 id=\"1-high-fees\">1. High fees</h3><p>Cross-border payments are subject to different fees along the way. Banks assess risk mitigation fees as well as fees for currency conversion and different payment methods. Wire transfers initiated in the U.S. can run upward to $50 per payment, for example, a number that can quickly add up depending on how many vendors and contractors you have overseas.</p><p><strong>Suggested reading</strong>: Learn <a href=\"__GHOST_URL__/how-to-pay-international-contractors-and-freelancers/\">how to pay international contractors</a></p><h3 id=\"2-slow-speed\">2. Slow speed</h3><p>While it’s true that digital payment options are making B2B cross-border payments faster, legacy methods still slow down the payment process. Checks, for example, leave vendors waiting for the mail to receive their payments and there’s additional time for the payment to settle until they can make it to their bank. With bank transfers, the lead times can stretch for days depending on how many financial infrastructures a payment needs to go through.</p><h3 id=\"3-limited-access\">3. Limited access</h3><p>The reality is that not all borders and jurisdictions have access to cross-border payment channels and some remain very limited. Maybe a local currency isn’t recognized or their local banks don’t participate in SWIFT. While there are options available for many B2B cross border payment methods, access is still limited for SMBs that encounter financial barriers within the finance landscape.</p><h3 id=\"4-lack-of-transparency\">4. Lack of transparency</h3><p>A major limitation of traditional cross-border payments is the lack of transparency from start to finish into fees, tracking and currency conversion rates. This challenge really ties into the previous three challenges — fees and transfer times are not known from the moment the payment is initiated. Finance teams tend to have a harder time tracking down where payments are when there are delays.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/S70PtFqNXKk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><figcaption>Learn more about cross-border payment challenges, methods and solutions in this webinar.</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2 id= \"fintech cross-border payments\"> How fintech is improving cross-border payments</h2><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Cross-border transactions compound the number of variables involved in a payment cycle, requiring AP teams to be knowledgeable of international regulations and restrictions as well as currencies and overseas banking schedules. Fintech is changing the way businesses approach cross-border payments, implementing advanced technologies to enhance the experience on both ends of payments.</p><h3 id=\"apis\">APIs</h3><p>Application Programming Interface (API) is an intermediary between two software components. Logging into an online banking interface is an example of an API. The API is the intermediary that connects your computer or phone to the bank’s server so that you can access your account information. Historically, the only way to access this information was to physically go to a bank location and request these details from a teller or ATM.</p><p>The applications of APIs are seemingly infinite and there was a <a href=\"https://www.g2.com/articles/the-api-driven-expansion-of-banking\">133% increase in fintech APIs</a> from 2019 to 2020. The more that APIs are implemented, the more versatile the financial ecosystem can become. APIs eliminate the need for finance teams to memorize international policies or track currency conversion rates, their fintech software is already doing it for them faster and with more accuracy.</p><h3 id=\"enhanced-visibility\">Enhanced visibility</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, one of the biggest hurdles that businesses need to overcome is two-way visibility in the cross-border payment cycle. Payment method fees, transfer fees, currency conversion and settlement lead times: each of these pieces in a payment puzzle need to be communicated to both parties to avoid friction in the vendor-to-buyer relationship.</p><p>Fintech aids in this transfer of information by acting as the intermediary between financial institutions, communicating at each end of the infrastructure and funneling the information back to the buyer and sender in real-time. This not only enhances confidence in the payment cycle but also eliminates guesswork and the need to chase down information from a foreign bank.</p><h3 id=\"virtual-accounts\">Virtual accounts</h3><p>Instead of going to a bank to open an account, businesses can now open virtual accounts — or bank accounts that can be opened online without ever having to step into a building. The ability to open an account remotely improves accessibility to underserved markets and industries. This eliminates the need for businesses to manage local bank accounts in order to facilitate and monitor currency conversion.</p><h3 id=\"user-experience\">User experience </h3><p>A recent study by EY found that <a href=\"https://www.ey.com/en_us/nextwave-financial-services/how-financial-institutions-can-win-the-battle-for-trust\">51% of Gen Z and 49% of millennials</a> favor a fintech company as their most trusted financial brand. Fintech adopts a digitally native experience to business needs, emphasizing mobile interface that can be accessed and utilized for myriad purposes from the comfort of a living room couch, the convenience of a bus stop bench or the versatility of, say, a gondola in Venice. As long as the user has access to the internet — or data on their mobile device — they can send and receive payments from anywhere.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2 id= \"cross-border payments routable\"> Sending cross-border payments with Routable</h2><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Looking for cross-border payments companies to help pay your international vendors and contractors?

Having\nthese documents on hand before the first invoice arrives helps make the\nfollowing steps easier since they include identifying information you need to\ncomplete payments.\n\nRelated reading: Tax documents W-8BEN-E Form\n[https://blog.routable.com/understanding-form-w-8ben-e/] and Form 1042-S\n[https://blog.routable.com/understanding-form-1042-s/]\n\nStep 2: Route\nOnce approvals for the payment are met, the payment can continue. You’ll need\nimportant identifying information from your vendor when you’re routing an\ninternational payment. If you’re sending a check or prepaid card, your vendor’s\nname and address will suffice. However, if you’re making a wire transfer or\ninternational ACH, you need a bank account number and/or an international\nrouting number. Have your vendor’s International Bank Account Number (IBAN)\nhandy as well.\n\nSuggested reading: What’s an IBAN? [__GHOST_URL__/what-is-iban/]\n\nStep 3: Approve or decline\nYour financial institution takes over processing the payment transfer. If\nthere’s an error with your bank communicating to a foreign financial\ninstitution, the payment will be stopped or declined. A number of reasons affect\napproval for international payments, including incorrect banking information.\nThere may also be more than just two financial institutions involved in the\ntransfer depending on where your vendor is located, which can further slow the\nprocess.\n\nStep 4: Settle\nIf all goes well, your payment will be approved. At this time, a foreign\nfinancial institution takes over and settles the final transfer of payment to\nyour vendor. The amount of time that it takes for a payment to settle depends on\nthe regulations in place by the local bank. Fees may be assessed at this stage\nof the process depending on currency conversion and the payment method used.\n\nStep 5: Track\nJust like a domestic payment, once a cross-border payment has been made and\nprocessed, your finance team will need to track whether the payment has been\napproved and settled. Unfortunately, two-way communication between payer and\npayee via their financial institutions is not always available. The payer may be\ninformed that a payment is declined while the payee isn’t notified. If there are\ndelays or hidden fees, both finance teams may spend time retracing the steps of\nthe process to resolve the issue.\n\n Challenges of cross-border payments\nWhile it’s exciting to work with international teams, making payments across\nborders brings about its own set of challenges. Here are the top four as\nidentified by the Financial Stability Board (FSB)\n[https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P131021-2.pdf].\n\n1. High fees\nCross-border payments are subject to different fees along the way. Banks assess\nrisk mitigation fees as well as fees for currency conversion and different\npayment methods. Wire transfers initiated in the U.S. can run upward to $50 per\npayment, for example, a number that can quickly add up depending on how many\nvendors and contractors you have overseas.\n\nSuggested reading: Learn how to pay international contractors\n[https://blog.routable.com/how-to-pay-international-contractors-and-freelancers/]\n\n2. Slow speed\nWhile it’s true that digital payment options are making B2B cross-border\npayments faster, legacy methods still slow down the payment process. Checks, for\nexample, leave vendors waiting for the mail to receive their payments and\nthere’s additional time for the payment to settle until they can make it to\ntheir bank. With bank transfers, the lead times can stretch for days depending\non how many financial infrastructures a payment needs to go through.\n\n3. Limited access\nThe reality is that not all borders and jurisdictions have access to\ncross-border payment channels and some remain very limited. Maybe a local\ncurrency isn’t recognized or their local banks don’t participate in SWIFT. While\nthere are options available for many B2B cross border payment methods, access is\nstill limited for SMBs that encounter financial barriers within the finance\nlandscape.\n\n4. Lack of transparency\nA major limitation of traditional cross-border payments is the lack of\ntransparency from start to finish into fees, tracking and currency conversion\nrates. This challenge really ties into the previous three challenges — fees and\ntransfer times are not known from the moment the payment is initiated. Finance\nteams tend to have a harder time tracking down where payments are when there are\ndelays.\n\nLearn more about cross-border payment challenges, methods and solutions in this\nwebinar. How fintech is improving cross-border payments\nCross-border transactions compound the number of variables involved in a payment\ncycle, requiring AP teams to be knowledgeable of international regulations and\nrestrictions as well as currencies and overseas banking schedules. Fintech is\nchanging the way businesses approach cross-border payments, implementing\nadvanced technologies to enhance the experience on both ends of payments.\n\nAPIs\nApplication Programming Interface (API) is an intermediary between two software\ncomponents. Logging into an online banking interface is an example of an API.\nThe API is the intermediary that connects your computer or phone to the bank’s\nserver so that you can access your account information. Historically, the only\nway to access this information was to physically go to a bank location and\nrequest these details from a teller or ATM.\n\nThe applications of APIs are seemingly infinite and there was a 133% increase\nin\nfintech APIs [https://www.g2.com/articles/the-api-driven-expansion-of-banking] \nfrom 2019 to 2020. The more that APIs are implemented, the more versatile the\nfinancial ecosystem can become. APIs eliminate the need for finance teams to\nmemorize international policies or track currency conversion rates, their\nfintech software is already doing it for them faster and with more accuracy.\n\nEnhanced visibility\nAs mentioned earlier, one of the biggest hurdles that businesses need to\novercome is two-way visibility in the cross-border payment cycle. Payment method\nfees, transfer fees, currency conversion and settlement lead times: each of\nthese pieces in a payment puzzle need to be communicated to both parties to\navoid friction in the vendor-to-buyer relationship.\n\nFintech aids in this transfer of information by acting as the intermediary\nbetween financial institutions, communicating at each end of the infrastructure\nand funneling the information back to the buyer and sender in real-time. This\nnot only enhances confidence in the payment cycle but also eliminates guesswork\nand the need to chase down information from a foreign bank.\n\nVirtual accounts\nInstead of going to a bank to open an account, businesses can now open virtual\naccounts — or bank accounts that can be opened online without ever having to\nstep into a building. The ability to open an account remotely improves\naccessibility to underserved markets and industries. This eliminates the need\nfor businesses to manage local bank accounts in order to facilitate and monitor\ncurrency conversion.\n\nUser experience \nA recent study by EY found that 51% of Gen Z and 49% of millennials\n[https://www.ey.com/en_us/nextwave-financial-services/how-financial-institutions-can-win-the-battle-for-trust] \nfavor a fintech company as their most trusted financial brand. Fintech adopts a\ndigitally native experience to business needs, emphasizing mobile interface that\ncan be accessed and utilized for myriad purposes from the comfort of a living\nroom couch, the convenience of a bus stop bench or the versatility of, say, a\ngondola in Venice. As long as the user has access to the internet — or data on\ntheir mobile device — they can send and receive payments from anywhere.\n\n Sending cross-border payments with Routable\nLooking for cross-border payments companies to help pay your international\nvendors and contractors? Routable offers the simplest way to send cross-border\npayments while addressing common challenges that pop up for businesses\nthroughout the process.\n\nChoose convenient payment methods and processing speeds, rely on an\neasy-to-scale API and establish preferred controls in AP workflows, all while\nproviding a user-friendly vendor experience. Plus, you’ll  have complete\ntransparency into currency conversion rates and fees so you know how your money\nis moving internationally.\n\nLearn more about making cross-border payments\n[https://routable.com/payables/cross-border-payments]with Routable.",

Global cross-border payments are expected\nto reach $156 trillion in 2022\n[https://www.ey.com/en_gl/banking-capital-markets/how-new-entrants-are-redefining-cross-border-payments]\n, with B2B transactions alone accounting for $150 trillion. An international ACH \ntransfer is one way for businesses to send payments globally, and it’s commonly\nused to pay vendors and suppliers abroad.\n\nIn this blog post, we’ll cover what international ACH transfers are, how to make\nan international ACH payment, the pros and cons of this method compared to other\nsolutions and more.\n\nWhat is international ACH? \nInternational ACH transfers (sometimes referred to as global ACH) offer\nbusinesses a way to pay their vendors, suppliers and independent contractors\naround the world via ACH payments.\n\nSuggested reading: What to know about business-to-business ACH\n[https://blog.routable.com/setting-up-ach-payments/]\n\nIf you’ve ever set up autopay for your cell phone bill or you’ve been paid via\ndirect deposit, you’ve used the Automated Clearing House (ACH). ACH is an\nelectronic network that facilitates transfers between bank accounts. While many\nACH transfers happen domestically, international ACH is used when payments need\nto be made between companies or individuals in different countries.\n\nInternational ACH payments are made directly to a recipient’s bank account\nthrough a clearing system, which varies depending on the country. There’s no one\nglobally accepted ACH system. In the United States, the system is the National\nAutomated Clearing House Association (Nacha\n[https://blog.routable.com/what-is-nacha/]), while in Europe, for example, it's\nprimarily the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA\n[https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/consumer-finance-and-payments/payment-services/single-euro-payments-area-sepa_en]\n).\n\nTransfers from the U.S. are required to follow all Nacha rules, including\nproviding necessary identifying information for each party in the transaction\nand having gateway operators classify any payments to and from financial\ninstitutions outside the country.\n\nDomestic ACH vs. international ACH: What’s the difference?\nThere are at least three differences to consider between domestic and ACH and\ninternational ACH:\n\nThe clearing system governing the transactions\n * Domestic transfers: Governed by Nacha\n * International transfers: Subject to Nacha regulations in addition to those of\n   the receiving country’s clearing system.\n\nProcessing times\n * Domestic ACH transfers: Typically take a day or so to go through\n * International ACH transfers: Can take longer (usually one to five days)\n   because of the additional governing clearing systems they have to go through.\n\nCost\n * Domestic ACH: Banks may charge about $3 or less.\n * International ACH: The cost can be similar to a domestic ACH, but may\n   sometimes cost a little more depending on the service you use.\n\nHow do I make an international ACH payment?\nFew traditional banks offer international ACH as a service, but online payment\nplatforms like Routable [https://routable.com/] make it easy to send a\ncross-border ACH.\n\nWhile regulatory requirements for international ACH transfers tend to be\ncomplex, online payment platforms eliminate much of this bureaucracy for the end\nuser by providing a secure environment for transfers and ensuring that all\nnecessary country-specific requirements are met.\n\nSuggested reading: A guide to cross-border payments\n[https://blog.routable.com/cross-border-payments-guide/]\n\nThey also tend to be more cost-effective than sending payments via your bank.\nThis is especially helpful when making mass payments where fees can really add\nup. International ACH payments are also much simpler to manage when using a\npayments platform, offering teams a centralized view of all payments both\ndomestic and cross-border.\n\nIf you would like to process the payment with your bank, it’s pretty\nstraightforward — if they offer the service. Here’s how it would generally work.\n\nHow to make an international ACH payment with your bank\n 1. Check that your bank offers international ACH payments.\n 2. Have your payee’s details ready. You’ll need their: * Name and address\n     * Bank account number\n       and routing number\n    \n    \n 3. Complete the payment via your bank’s online portal, over the phone or in\n    person. * Confirm the cost, including fees and the currency exchange rate\n    \n    \n\nHow long does international ACH take? \nInternational ACH transfers can take between one to five business days to clear,\nwith most taking around three days.\n\nThis is due to security and regulations, as well as the fact that most banks\nprocess ACH transfers in batches. Even after approving the transfer, the\nreceiving bank may take a bit of time to deposit the money into the recipient’s\naccount.\n\nThese transfers are almost always very low cost (under three dollars) or even\nfree in some cases.\n\nInternational ACH transfer vs. international ACH transaction (IAT)\nIt’s important to note that an international ACH transfer is different from an\ninternational ACH transaction (IAT). \n\n * International ACH transfer refers to the movement of money from one place to\n   another across international borders.\n * IAT, on the other hand, is the SEC code used for those types of transfers.\n\nAll international ACH payments that originate from or come into the United\nStates must have IAT reports submitted to Nacha (the United States’s clearing\nhouse for ACH transfers) to make sure that the payments are in line with all\nlegal requirements.\n\nInternational ACH vs. wire transfer: What’s the difference?\nBoth international ACH transfers and wire transfers allow people to transfer\nmoney between accounts at different banks, but they accomplish that goal in\ndifferent ways.\n\nRelated reading: All about international wire transfers\n[https://blog.routable.com/international-wire-transfer/]\n\nHere are a few key differences:\n\n 1. Transfer networks: While ACH transfers use the Automated Clearing House\n    network, wire transfers use different networks (usually the SWIFT or Fedwire\n    networks) to transfer money.\n 2. Speed: ACH transfers are usually slower to process than wires, since banks\n    batch-process these payments. This is particularly true for international\n    ACH transfers, which can take up to five days to go through.\n 3. Cost: ACH transfers are much more cost-effective than wire transfers.\n    International wire transfers can cost up to $50 per transaction, which adds\n    up quickly. For this reason, ACH transfers are a better choice for regular\n    or multiple payments while wire transfers make more sense for one-time,\n    time-sensitive payments.\n 4. Security: Both ACH and wire transfers are generally secure. However, it's\n    important to be aware of and take precautions against wire transfer fraud.\n    In these schemes, scammers pose as a trusted contact (like a vendor,\n    business or family member) and request a wire transfer for a seemingly\n    legitimate reason, then steal the money that is sent.\n\nPros and cons of international ACH for your business\nPrior to the advent of online payment platforms, the main con of international\nACH transfers was the fact that few banks offered this payment option. Now that\nonline payment platforms have made international ACH a viable choice, it’s worth\nconsidering the pros and cons of this payment method.\n\nPros of international ACH payments\n * Low cost: ACH transfers are an inexpensive way to transfer money\n   internationally. International ACH fees usually range from $0 - $3.\n * Secure: ACH transfers happen over a secure network and are carefully\n   regulated by both the originating and receiving country, which provides peace\n   of mind when transferring large sums.\n * Mass payouts: Low-cost ACH transfers are a good option when paying multiple\n   vendors or contractors at once.\n * Money goes directly into the recipient’s bank account. Unlike some other\n   digital payment methods, international ACH is a direct-to-bank transfer,\n   meaning the money doesn’t get stuck in a third-party holding account. Your\n   recipient has access to their funds more quickly.\n\nCons of international ACH payments \n * Slower: International ACH transfers are typically slower than wire transfers\n   (though likely still faster than mailing a physical check).\n * Not accepted by all countries: While many countries accept ACH transfers,\n   there are still some that do not.\n\nSending international ACH payments with Routable\nRoutable offers an easy-to-use solution for customers looking to send\ninternational ACH payments to vendors and contractors across the world, all with\na single CSV file upload.\n\nRoutable’s international ACH payment process takes only two steps:\n\n1.

            "plaintext": "\n\nMorning\n7:00 a.m.-ish\n\nI start my day as a dad and husband. My son choses a cinnamon raisin bagel — so\nhe can pick out the raisins first. My wife and I hit the heavy stuff this\nmorning: boldly brewed Irish breakfast tea that’s more honey and cream than tea.\n\nAuthor Adam Jaffe Back and his son on a morning bike ride to preschoolBecause\nRoutable is a fully-remote (and remote first!) company, I have the pleasure of\nliving and working from almost anywhere I want. For my family, that means\nAshland, Oregon, just north of the California border. I can bike my kid to\npreschool most mornings.\n\n9:00 a.m.\n\nAs an Agile team, we start our work day with a 15-minute standup. Our team\nmembers live in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Puerto Rico, Paraguay,\nSlovenia and the Czech Republic. With so many different time zones, it helps to\nhave a quick sync every day to stay aligned on projects.\n\nAfter that synchronous meeting is done, I’ll read through all of my asynchronous\nSlack messages. Most of our communication happens in Slack, so I want to make\nsure I’m not blocking anyone. Anything that I’m not able to respond to\nimmediately, I’ll set a reminder for later.\n\n9:30 a.m.\n\nToday I have the opportunity to meet one-on-one with three of my direct reports.\nEvery engineer sets their own cadence, duration and topic for what they feel\nbest supports them. For example, some of my direct reports just want to talk\nabout life for 30 minutes while others want to pair program for an hour.\n\nWe use Lattice to facilitate our one-on-ones because every meeting is better\nwith at least a little bit of an agenda. We also track progress on professional\ndevelopment goals and 360 reviews. Continuous feedback and iteration is super\nimportant to us at Routable.\n\nA view of Adam's 1:1 agendaAfternoon\n12:00 p.m.\n\nThere’s a misunderstanding between our team (we call them “Pods”) and another\nteam about how their work will impact a feature we’ve roadmapped for next\nquarter. We had a Slack thread that started to get longer than was useful, so we\nmade the call to get together for a Zoom meeting. (See what I did there?)\n\nMy job as an engineering manager is to facilitate this meeting between two tech\nleads, a project manager and a designer. The project manager and designer have\nthe best global view of the project. The tech leads can discuss the nuts and\nbolts of the technical specification.\n\nGood news! The other team actually absorbed our project requirements into\nanother project they were doing, so we’re left with far less scope than\npreviously expected. Not only that, but we all discovered Zoom avatars and\ndecided to have our call in the metaverse.\n\nOn Zoom: Is it Adam or is it a cow? 🐮Was it hard to stay focused? Yes. \n\nWas it worth it? 100%. \n\nShould our Lead Product Manager Brent always come to work as a rabbit?\nAbsolutely.\n\n1:00 p.m.\n\nAfter a quick lunch of last night’s leftovers (Dal Bhat), I work through my\naccumulated Slack messages.\n\nIn one message left in our #pod-core-team Slack channel, an engineer had a\nquestion about acceptance criteria for a ticket to integrate Google Apps SSO.\nThe product manager quickly replied to unblock them, clarifying that we could\nkeep the scope as-is for our limited availability release and consider this edge\ncase for general availability.\n\nThe Slack interaction is a great example of some of our foundational values at\nRoutable [https://routable.com/about]: Own It, Build with Purpose and Engage\nwith Empathy. \n\nBecause the engineer owns their project, they knew when to take action to solve\nthe problem. They also knew the right question to ask because of their empathy\ntoward our customers. The project manager felt a similar ownership to unblock a\nteam member and shared empathy for the engineer’s confusion by developing a\ncustomer-focused way forward based on their broad knowledge of our product and\ncustomers.\n\nSpeaking of values…\n\n1:15 p.m.\n\nEvery company has certain State and Federal harassment training requirements,\nbut Routable takes it a step further by engaging employees every month with\nshort training sessions called “nudges.” The topic this month is Inclusive\nWorkplace Best Practices. We learn how to support team members with disabilities\nthrough the lens of our own privilege, including how race and gender can\nintersect to create multiple layers of discrimination in the workplace.\n\nPhew. That’s a lot, but it’s important work we’re all committed to. No one is\nperfect at this stuff, but we’re all trying to just be better than we were\nyesterday.\n\n1:30 p.m.\n\nMy team is working on making better use of Jira. We believe that if we invest\nsome time in the automation that Jira can provide us, we’ll be more productive\nand hit less roadblocks. Specifically, today I’m working on templatizing our\ndescriptions so that each ticket has a summary, dev notes and acceptance\ncriteria. I’ll also build some filters and dashboards to give us a better sense\nof our velocity.\n\nA view of Adam's Jira template2:15 p.m.\n\nWe have two new team members joining our team next Monday! We’re a little\ndifferent than most startups who say, “You’ll push your first commit on Day 1.”\nWe really want you to learn the culture, processes and product first. That sets\nthe tone and expectation of collaboration for the kinds of conversations I had\nearlier today.\n\nA Slack exchange between a new Routable employee and AdamEach Sprouter (our term\nfor new Routable employees) gets their own onboarding checklist, multiple\nwelcome calls and a dedicated onboarding buddy. Teamwork makes the dream work.\n\n3:00 p.m.\n\nSince I’m already in Notion working on my new team members’ onboarding plans, I\ntake the opportunity to review some of the product and technical documents our\nproject manager and tech lead have put together for an upcoming project. While\nI’m a people manager first, I also help with system and code architecture,\nespecially on the frontend where my strengths lie.\n\n4:00 p.m.\n\nEvery engineering manager at Routable has their own quarterly project to improve\npain points.

What can I get\ndone to hit the ground running? Are there any meetings I need to prep for?\nLooking even further ahead: Am I going to be able to hit my medium-term\nresponsibilities or do I need to shift and reallocate?\n\nA busy day ahead: A look into Adam's calendarEvening\n5:30 p.m.-ish\n\nBack to dad-mode. It’s time to cook dinner — we’re having pesto shrimp and\ncapellini tonight. And a salad. Probably maybe.\n\nTogether as a family, we take a walk around the block and enjoy the world as it\nslows down after a day at work.

            "plaintext": "As a remote-native company, Routable prioritizes fostering an engaging and\ncollaborative culture. One of our favorite ways of doing this is through\nhackathons. \n\nFrom time to time, we leave the comfort of our homes to meet each other in\nperson and hack together on projects, flying out to different cities across the\ncountry. Of course, Routers (Routable employees) have the option of\nparticipating remotely, too.\n\nIn our last hackathon, Routers were asked to come up with a project to promote\nor improve remote culture. The results were fantastic with different projects\nshowcasing everyone’s creativity: from a multiplayer game where teams compete to\nmove players across randomly generated mazes (a fun, nerdy ice-breaker before\nmeetings) to new tools to share team knowledge on Slack.\n\nIt's easy to communicate with each other when hacking together in person, but\ngoing remote can present a different set of obstacles to overcome. To showcase\nhow Routable’s remote teams came together to create amazing MVPs (minimum viable\nproducts), we selected Team 2^3 to tell us about their experience building their\nremote project, Give a Duck. \n\nWhat's Give a Duck? \nFirst, let’s talk about what the team created during the hackathon.\n\nGive a Duck is an app to show appreciation to your team virtually, and it's a\ntangible way to express one of Routable’s company values: Engage with empathy\n[https://routable.com/about]. \n\nWant to give a shoutout to a team member to let everyone know about their hard\nwork? The answer is DUCK YES.\n\nHow to send a duck in the Give a Duck appUsers can gift different types of\nducks:\n\nThe Appreciation Duck \nShoutout your teammate for a recent win, and let your teammate know how much you\nadmire them with words of encouragement.\n\nThe Compassion Duck\nSupport your teammate by letting them know you’re there for them no matter the\nweather. When you notice that someone is having a rough time, send luck in the\nform of a duck to brighten their day.\n\nThe Thanks Duck\nShow your teammate that you value their hard work and contributions. If you\nnotice someone exceeding expectations and overcoming challenges to reach their\ngoals, send this duck to tell them you appreciate their awesome work.\n\nThe Learned Duck\nShow some love when you notice that a teammate has been expanding their\nknowledge in a particular area. Let's face it, onboarding and learning new\nthings can be rough so just Duck it and give a Learned Duck to your teammate.\n\nAnd to unlock secret ducks while using the app, users just enter a Konami code\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code]. \n\nA screenshot of the Give a Duck remote hackathon projectSome secret ducks users\ncan unlock: \n\nThe Duck it Duck\nTook a risk and tried something new? #YOLO\n\nThe Zero Ducks Duck\nDon't give zero ducks? Go with the flow, do whatever you want, and let someone\nelse drive in the meantime. #IDGAD (I don't give a duck.)\n\nThe Tom Duck\nRockstar. Talented singer. Superhero. Lifeline.\n\nHow Team 2^3 hacked together remotely\nWe asked a few Routers from team Give A Duck about their experience completing a\nhackathon without the convenience of working together in person: Chris Bishop, a\nlead frontend developer on the Payment Automation pod, and director of\nengineering Linda Renard. Here's what they shared. \n\nThe benefits and challenges of a remote hackathon\nAs a remote native company, having a remote-friendly hackathon felt like a\nnatural fit. Routers could fully participate in the hackathon without changes in\ntheir normal routines or family time. This also made it easier for teammates who\nwere not comfortable traveling coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis hackathon was also an opportunity for Routers from around the world to\nconnect. Teams formed with members from all departments and functions, allowing\nRouters to spend time with other Routers they do not get to interact with daily.\nAs team members joined from different time zones, this also meant projects could\nbe worked on around the clock as teammates picked up where others left off.\n\nA remote hackathon option provided a new canvas for teammates to gel in short\nperiods of time. Routers are used to collaborating in a remote fashion, but\nthey're often doing so with the same set of teammates, so everyone is already\nfamiliar with each other's work styles. To figure out how to best spend time\ntogether with new teammates, many teams kicked things off by having deep\nconversations about strengths and weaknesses.\n\nOne notable challenge, however, was finding ways to balance hackathon tasks with\nother run-of-the-mill work tasks that came up. For example, if a Router had a\nmajor feature being released around the same time, it could be challenging to\nwant to prioritize a hackathon project remotely.\n\nStrategies and tools that helped Team 2^3 with remote collaboration\nTo make this remote hackathon work, the team applied the same tools and\ntechniques they use daily to run their remote sprints. They would start a day\nwith a synchronous brainstorming session — similar to a standup — where they\ndiscussed progress, blockers and ideas. They used Notion to document everything\nand a dedicated Slack channel to chat.\n\nThroughout the day, they had regular async check-ins to answer questions and\nhelp each other out. They also jumped on calls to collaborate on a given problem\ntogether.\n\nEvery team member had the expectation of being transparent with their\navailability and progress, and to mirror the straightforward and clear\ncommunication style employed at Routable daily. Direct communication made it\neasier to handle situations where hackathon team members had to be pulled into\ntime-sensitive situations as some of us were still working on our regular\nday-to-day tasks.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you'd like to join the team at Routable, see our current openings here\n[https://routable.com/careers]. \n\nLear more about what it's like to work at Routable: \n\n * A day in the life of an engineering manager at Routable\n   [__GHOST_URL__/day-in-the-life-engineering-manager/]\n * Developer spotlight: Justin Myers, Principal Software Engineer\n   [__GHOST_URL__/developer-spotlight-justin-myers-principal-software-engineer/]\n * Q+A: Meet Shobhan Agarwal, Routable's VP of Finance\n   [__GHOST_URL__/meet-routable-vp-finance/]",

ACH can only be used for domestic payments within the U.S. So, if your vendors are stateside, ACH is perfect to use. But if you need a payment method for international vendors, SWIFT can be an option to provide that framework.</p><h3 id=\"swift-has-higher-transaction-fees-than-ach\">SWIFT has higher transaction fees than ACH</h3><p>SWIFT payment fees are much higher than ACH fees. A SWIFT payment can run as high as $50, which means that batch payments can get pretty expensive. Plus, there may be an additional receiving fee depending on what bank is involved.</p><p>ACH fees are much lower per transaction. Most standard ACH fees are either a percentage or flat fee per transaction. Percentages range between .05% and 1.5% per transaction whereas flat rates range from $.20 to $1.50 per transaction. There are also higher fees for more premium options like Same Day which can be up to $2 per transaction. Many payment platforms, however, will work with high-volume or mass payout users to bring those costs down.</p><h3 id=\"swift-carries-a-little-more-risk-than-ach\">SWIFT carries a little more risk than ACH</h3><p>As with any wire transfer, once the payment has been initiated, stopping or reversing the wire transfer is incredibly difficult. Unfortunately, wire fraud is on the rise so it’s imperative to take precautionary steps and ensure that the transaction details you provide are accurate before initiating a wire transfer. ACH payments do provide some assurance that if a payment needs to be stopped, it can be, but there is typically a fee associated with this process.</p><h3 id=\"swift-is-faster-than-ach-sometimes\">SWIFT is faster than ACH, sometimes</h3><p>SWIFT payments may process in as fast as one day. However, as mentioned earlier, the time to settlement becomes delayed depending on the banks involved in the transaction. The more intermediary banks involved, the longer the payment will take to deposit.</p><p>Standard ACH payments settle between three and five business days. They are processed in batches that are subject to various cut-off times throughout the day. If a cut-off time is missed, the payment will need to wait until the next cut-off time to be processed. There are faster ACH options like Same Day, but these do carry a premium fee.</p><h2 id=\"about-international-ach\">About international ACH </h2><p>Also known as international ACH transfers, payments using this method are made directly to a recipient’s bank account through a clearing system.

Checks display bank\naccount numbers, and when in the wrong hands, this sensitive financial\ninformation can lead to compromised funds and lost assets.\n\nMailed checks don’t offer easy tracking. When a check is in the mail, there\nisn’t an efficient way to track where that check is, which leaves both the agent\nand broker waiting for it to arrive. You know the frustration if you’ve ever\nlost a check in the mail. Scrambling to make up for lost mail leads to late fees\nand agent churn.\n\nCheck payments burden your finance team\nIt isn’t just the agent that has to deal with check payment challenges. There’s\na negative impact on your finance team, too.\n\nChecks take up time and eat into budget. Finance teams have to print and\nphysically send out each check payment. This manual process not only takes up\ntime, but the costs add up. The average cost of processing one check is around\n$4 to $20, including labor, paper and postage costs.\n\nTeams are overrun with agent check-ins. As mentioned, if you’re mailing paper\nchecks, there’s a waiting game involved with no way to figure out where that\npayment may be at any given time. But just like you appreciate notifications\nletting you know when a delivery is on its way, commission-driven agents want to\nknow when they can expect their payment.\n\nThese issues compound as you scale. If your real estate agency is sending out\nfive or 10 commission checks a week with each agent checking in on their\npayment, that may seem like a sustainable workload for your finance team. But\nnow factor in payments to other vendors and added commission checks as your\nportfolio grows. Suddenly five or 10 becomes 100 or 500, and those check-in\nphone calls and empty envelopes add up.\n\nWhat you miss by relying on bank portals\nIt's common for real estate finance teams to use their business’s bank portal to\ncapture transaction details. As part of the workflow, your team may take this\ninformation and manually input it into your accounting software. This two-step\nprocess in two different systems unfortunately increases the possibility of\nerrors.\n\nThe tedious work of moving back and forth isn’t the only issue, even with the\nmost careful, detail-oriented staff.\n\nYou’re also not getting a complete insight into payables…\nYour bank portal may provide less visibility and control for both payer and\npayee. For example, your finance team doesn’t receive complete remittance\ndetails when you make a wire transfer with your bank. They might be able to see\nthe payment recipient and the amount, but there probably isn’t a property\nreference number or address. Your finance team will have to manually match the\nwire’s information against commission details for each agent.\n\nWhat’s more, the agent isn’t receiving a confirmation of the payment. They more\nthan likely constantly check their bank account to confirm a deposit, creating\nanxiety in the payment process that doesn’t bolster confidence in your agency.\n\n…and you’re disconnected from your accounting software\nYour bank portal doesn't integrate into your accounting software, which prevents\nyour finance team from a singular view of your payables. Just like the lack of\npayments insight, the disconnect between the two systems means that your finance\nteam has to continually move between systems to find and verify transaction\ndata.\n\nHow Routable’s AP automation software modernizes your payables\nAs a preferred real estate payments platform built for sending payouts to\nbrokers, landlords and real estate agents, our payment solutions get your agents\npaid efficiently — on time, every time.
